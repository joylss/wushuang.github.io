            Hello! You can call me Joan. I'm the single/lone person behind this website, translations, with the help of a friend currently kind enough to beta my translations. 
            I'm translating off the raws from JJWXC and I'm hosting this site for free, now, so I'm terribly sorry for the ugly domain name. This site is coded by me personally within the span of three days.
            It is intended to only to provide the basic functionality of a very common website, however, I might add comments section in the future. Please do not try to destroy my site.
            Also, common courtesy: Do not post my translations elsewhere, thank you!
        </p>
        <p>If you have any suggestions, feedbacks, opinons about my translations, or want to report a bug on the site, feel free to contact me via twitter. Honestly, this is the first time I'm doing something like this, so I appreciate it!</p>
