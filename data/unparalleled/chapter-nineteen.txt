</p><h2>Chapter 19 – You Whose Surname Is Feng, You Motherfucking Bastard!</h2><br><br>

<p>Qiao Xian sat in the tea house, watching the
amber-coloured liquid in her bowl, daydreaming as the tea reflected the colour
of the sunset. </p><p>Slowly, the light of the sunset disappeared
and the owner of the house lit the candles, walking over to ask Qiao Xian if
she wanted a bowl of hot noodle soup.</p><p>Qiao Xiao declined.</p><p>She was not used to bitter tea that brought a
little saltiness. In the Zuoyue Alliance, everyone knew that the Commander’s
subordinate Qiao Xiao loved sour plum tea.</p><p>But in a place like this, where the cold has
yet to retreat, there was not a single shadow of sour plum tea. </p><p>Just as Qiao Xiao raised the teacup to her
lips for the fifth time, one she savoured it, her eyebrows wrinkled. Finally,
Zhangsun Bodhi appeared.</p><p>Slowly, the other walked out of the Spring
Moon, as if they have long agreed to wait here for the other. He was walking
towards the tea house casually.</p><p>“You are an hour late.” She said as Zhangsun
sat down. </p><p>Zhangsun, “It is you who is early.”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “What did you find out?”</p><p>Zhangsun spoke a bit too late, “The scent on
her body was made by someone called Lady Miao. The lady apparently knew a lot
about perfumes and could make whatever scent she wanted. The reason Yunyun
could make a name in the Spring Moon was also because of her.”</p><p>If either Feng Xiao or Cui Buqu was present,
once they hear of the name Lady Miao, they would have made the connection with
the concubine of the Khotan ambassador Qin Miaoyu, but they were not here, so
Zhangsun and Qiao Xian both were clueless. </p><p>However, even so, Zhangsun and Qiao Xiao both
managed to understand the reason why Cui Cuqu wanted them to investigate the
plum blossom scent. </p><p>“This Lady Miao must be a key to the person
the Commander wants to find.” Qiao Xian said, “But you were with her a whole
day, you only managed to find out about this clue?”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi looked at her silently, that
would meant that he asked her back <i>‘Then
what did you find out?’</i></p><p>Qiao Xian, “Originally I was tailing her
handmaid, but who knew I saw her outside looking enviously at you and Lady
Yunyun, so I pretended to be a wounded martial artist from Jianghu who
accidentally came into the Spring Moon and let her save me, then feigned pity
and managed to ask a few things.”</p><p>She had some scent on her made her smell like
a sharp beauty, but if she swapped into the body of a male, then it turned into
something elegant. It would make women go mad with craze. After staring for a
long time, one would feel that Qiao Xian even felt manly.</p><p>For the first time, Zhangsun Bodhi’s gaze
lingered on Qiao Xian for a long while, confusion showing in his eyes.</p><p>“You—are
you a male or a female?”</p><p>Qiao
Xian replied plainly, “After reading buddist scripts for so long, don’t you
understand that ‘looks are only the mind’s perception, and are meaningless’?”</p><p>Zhangsun
replied silently, turning the Buddha beads in his hands, and muttered <i>amitabha</i> under his breathe.</p><p>“You
are right. I have strayed.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “Nothing happened between you and Lady Yunyun?”</p><p>Zhangsun
said calmly, “After I asked what I wanted, I put her to sleep, then I left.”</p><p>After
she woke up, perhaps she might remember Zhangsun Bodhi, but she would not
recall why she had fainted. It was as if it was all a dream.</p><p>From
then on, they walk their separate ways, never to meet again.</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi quickly brought himself back to reality.</p><p>“What
did you manage to find out?” He parted his mouth to ask.</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “From the handmaiden, I managed to ask the location of the Lady Miao. She
said that Yunyun secretly bought a manor and originally wanted to move there
when she could redeem herself. Since Lady Miao helped her back in the Spring
Moon, she wanted to repay her, so she offered to let Lady Miao live there for
some amount of time. I also wanted to see what sort of deity is that Lady
Miao.”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi raised his head and asked, “It is almost dark, why are we still not
moving?”</p><p>Qiao
Xian did not answer and called for the owner, and asked for two bowls of soup
noodles.</p><p>“It
is still early. Let’s eat before leaving.”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi nodded his head.</p><p>Originally,
he was not a man of many words. If he could choose, he would have took a sword
and fought his enemies to the death. Just now although Lady Yunyun was
incredibly cooperative, but after he walked out of the Spring Moon, Zhangsun
Bodhi’s lips gave away his nervousness.</p><p>Until
now only did he manage to made himself relax.</p><p>Qiao
Xian saw him hesitated, so she said, “Compared to the House of Blades, the
Zuoyue Alliance is still short of men.”</p><p>If
only the Commander could have someone who is both intelligent and skilled in
martial arts, perhaps this time he wouldn’t have need to set out himself.</p><p>“Compared
to watching the Commander lie down on a bed half a month, I rather he expose
himself more to the outsides. It helps his illness.” It was rare to see
Zhangsun speak a moderately long sentence.</p><p>Qiao
Xiao furrowed her brows, “But in Feng Xiao’s hands, he would not be
comfortable.”</p><p>As
the conversation approached to this end, the noodles came. Both of them no
longer spoke, only ate their meal silently.</p><p>The
noodle soup is no other than usual vegeterian noodles. The soup, naturally, are
cooked from well water. On top of the noodles were a few spring onions and wild
lettuces. This was enough to make a full meal for the citizens of this
marketplace.</p><p>This
sort of noodles, perhaps, compared to what Zhangsun and Qiao Xian used to eat,
was vastly different, however, because if their hunger added with cold weather,
once the soup washed into their stomachs, they felt warmth that was enough to
spread throughout the body, chasing away all the fatigue.</p><p>Qiao
Xian and Zhangsun both thought of the same thing.</p><p>If
only the Commander was here, how nice that would be. They did not know if he
could even drink a bowl of soup at this moment?</p><p>……</p><p>Naturally,
Cui Buqu was not drinking soup. Not only that, but he still had to stand out in
the snow, enduring the cold, and refraining himself from coughing too much.</p><p>However,
he is in a very good mood.</p><p>Because
before him right now, Feng Xiao is in a battle of one against five.</p><p>“Take
the jade from the manor.” He heard Feng Xiao telling Pei Jingzhe.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe did not know what Feng Xiao had in mind, but he obeyed nevertheless and
quickly brought the jade. </p><p>The
moonlight is not bad, the jade glowed in Feng Xiao’s hands like crystals in the
night. One could also see a tints of green light illuminating from it.</p><p>Regardless
whether this is the Jade of Heaven’s Lake or not, without a doubt, this is a
beautiful jade.</p><p>Everyone
present glanced at the jade stone and their eyes shone.</p><p>Feng
Xiao pushed himself upwards and said in a voice loud, “Did all of you came for
the jade?”</p><p>Among
the five uninvited guest, only the yellow-robed woman wanted to simply take a
look at the jade. The other four remained silent and did not state their
purpose.</p><p>In
the midst of the awkward silence, no one dared to speak, it was as if they were
having a battle of silence. </p><p>Feng
Xiao was not in a hurry, Cui Buqu was even more not in a hurry. The only one
who was currently shivering in anxiety was Pei Jingzhe.</p><p>He
knew he hadn’t trained enough and he was unwilling to embarrass Feng Xiao, so
he inhaled deeply, suppressing his feelings and acted.</p><p>The
yellow-robed woman was the first to break the silence, “I am the first to
appear, and I have no intentions to defy the House of Blades. I am only a weak
woman and here, cold winds have been bellowing for the entire night. Please
pity me, Lord Feng, let me have a look, so I have something to tell when I
return.” </p><p>Her
smile was shallow. Originally, it was because she had quite a normal face that
would leave no one impression, but because her voice was melodious, everyone
present could not help but turned towards her.</p><p>Cui
Buqu surveyed the place and realized that there were two people who did not
look at the yellow-robed woman. One is the one wearing a bamboo hat, the one
that he was unable to determine whether he was male or female, and the other
one was the Turk.</p><p>The
Turk’s attention, since the beginning to the end, had been on Feng Xiao.</p><p>Only
high-level martial artist would not allow anything to distract them from their
mission.</p><p>As
for the man in black who hid in the shadows…….</p><p>The
other’s body was leaning sideways, standing very far away, his left hand
holding his right, pressing on it from time to time.</p><p>Cui
Buqu’s eyes squinted a little.</p><p>Feng
Xiao did not observe the others. He had been looking at the yellow-robed woman
as if within this manor, she was the only one present.</p><p>Seeing
the other smiled, he smiled as well. “Since you are mannerly, I should give the
jade to you first. However, I do not even know your name. What if once you took
it and ran away, how should I know where to find you?”</p><p>The
yellow-robed woman said, “I am Bing Xian.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao twitched his eyebrows, “Your surname is Bing? How rare.”</p><p>Bing
Xian, “Names and the like are nothing but addresses. Just like Lord Feng
yourself, is your name also not unusual and unparalleled, bringing the elegance
of a generation?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao laughed loudly, “Compared to those unmannerly fools, you have earned my favour!
The House of Blades need people like you who are understanding, why not
consider joining me, I will guarantee you will be well taken care of, you
definitely need not stand out here outside the manor enduring the cold winds!”</p><p>Bing
Xuan smiled, as if she wanted to say something, but suddenly, Feng Xiao
snatched the jade from Pei Jingzhe’s hands and threw it towards her.</p><p>“Since
I like you the most, I shall lend you the jade first!”</p><p>Bing
Xuan was caught by surprise. She had never thought that Feng Xiao would just
surrender the jade without warning, so without hesitation, she lunged herself towards
the jade.</p><p>However,
even if she was quick, there was someone quicker than her.</p><p>The
man clad in white with a bamboo hat and the man in grey flew towards the jade
at the same time.</p><p>The
Turk did not even looked at the jade. Taking out a long knife in his hand, he
flew towards Feng Xiao in a deadly motion with the force of crumbling mountains
and violent waves.</p><p>The
gesture was so impactful that Cui Buqu, who stood behind Feng Xiao, could also
feel the gust of wind coming from it. He could not help but took a few steps
back. He almost hit the wall with his back, but suddenly someone pulled him to
the side. He blinked, and realized Feng Xiao had pulled him into his arms.</p><p>However,
the Turk’s knife’s came from above. Cui Buqu felt his hair come loose and
suddenly his hair fell all around him.</p><p>High-level
martial artists such as Feng Xiao would know that just now, with how the Turk’s
intention was to take someone by surprise, it would at least have pulled off
the jade hairpiece in his hair. In order to stop his hair from becoming messy,
he took Cui Buqu to block the wind.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not need a mirror to know that he looked like a psychopath now with
now messy his hair had become. A wave of disgust rose from his chest and he
scolded loudly, “You whose surname is Feng, you mother fucking bastard!”</p><p>In
the next moment, he realized the Turk indirectly avenged him, because Feng Xiao
was provoked by the other, he had no time to bicker with Cui Buqu.</p><p>That
jade was just touched by the man in grey, but before he could revel over it, he
realize the jade was suddenly beginning to crack in his palms, turning into
dust that was blown away by the wind.</p><p>

All three who were after the jade stared it at
in bewilderment.
