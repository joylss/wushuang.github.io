<h2>Chapter 28 – My Surname Is ‘Zhangsun’, Name ‘Bodhi’, I Am One Of The Vice-Commanders Of The Zuoyue Bureau</h2><br><br>


<p>The
North has always been plagued by the shadows of the Turk. Generations and
generations of kings have strived to secure the peace of the North to avoid the
going into war with the Turks. Although wolves will always be wolves, they
would not stop hunting just because they fed. Once the feeding stopped, their
natural personality would resurface once more, rolling back their snouts and
leap into the hunt once more.</p><p>Then
the former Northern Empire reigned, Princess Qianjin married the Khan Ishbara
to sustain peace between the Central Plains and the Turk, and both sides were
at peace. But ever since Yang Jian’s coronation as Emperor, Princess Qianjin
hated him for the treason he caused, murdering her entire family, so she
convinced her husband to go against the Central Plains. The Khan Ishbara was
also no coward, so he promised his queen and sent out soldiers.</p><p>Since
the year before the last, the war have been fought for over a year. Khan
Ishbara united all the Khans near his kingdom and raised an army of one hundred
thousand men, splitting ways as they marched onto the long city. &nbsp;From Mayi, Khan Ishbara ventured into the
South. The Sui soldiers fought fiercely and both won and lost wars. However,
Emperor Yang Jian wanted to preserve his strength, to avoid Nanchen being
attacked by Goguryeo, he was unable to spare all his men to battle with the
Turks. So he had no choice but to soothe Princess Qianjin, and to also sustain
his relationship with the Chen imperial court, he used the awkward fame of the
Turk on all corners of the earth, intending to turn it to his advantage.</p><p>It’s because of this situation, Cui
Buqu was sent to the outskirts of the city.</p><p>By orders of the Emperor, General Zhangsun
Cheng and Yuan Hui from the Court of the Imperial Stud was sent out to the
Yellow Dragon Ally and the Yiwu Ally to discuss terms with Khan Ishbara as well
as Khan Bagha and Khan Tardu. On the other hand, Cui Buqu was responsible for
receiving the Khan Apa’s ambassador to convince him not to ally with Khan
Ishbara. They were separated into two groups to achieve two different goals.</p><p>However, Khan Ishbara’s forces were
too powerful. Even if Khan Apa agrees to ally with the Sui Empire, they were
not brave enough to flaunt it, so they have to meet in secret in the City of
Six Crafts.</p><p>More than a month ago, not long ago
just after Cui Buqu arrived in the City if Six Crafts, Khan Apa has already
sent out an ambassador, it’s only because that before the ambassador had
reached the city, he ate something spoiled and vomited and died. Qiao Xian and
Zhangsun Bodhi who had followed Cui Buqu to the City of Six Crafts went to
investigate as they felt that the ambassador’s death was suspicious, but
managed to find no leads, but it is because of this, they were even more wary
than before.</p><p> Resourced were expended for news to travel
back and forth, and no little amount of time was wasted, until a little while
ago, Khan Apa sent out another ambassador, taking precautions to be even more
secretive. Only after the ambassador reached Qiemo, they informed the Zuoyue
Bureau’s scout. According to information, they would arrive within three to
five days.</p><p>Cui Buqu was originally bound to
duty and would not have crossed paths with the House of Blades, however,
because of the murder of the Khotan ambassador and the loss of the Jade, since
he was coincidentally in the City of Six Crafts, if he sat there and did
nothing, then it would not have been the style of Cui Buqu.</p><p>So as he scouted for information on
Feng Xiao’s side, discovering the lead of the plum blossoms and sending news
back to Qiao Xian and Zhangsun to investigate, he wanted to get to the jade
first and claim the glory of solving the case. Feng Xiao, on the other hand, would
not have even guessed that while Cui Buqu had been by his side all along, the
Five Tastes restaurant had been the stronghold that the Zuoyue Bureau set up
there.</p><p>Cui Buqu did purposely mislead Feng
Xiao, allowing Zhangsun to set up a pit for Wen Liang and being captured by
Feng Xiao at the same time, convincing him that Wen Liang is a key figure in
the case.</p><p>As for the need of working
together, Cui Buqu only told him part of the truth, what he thinks were needed
to know, meticulously picking out the contents of what he wanted to say.</p><p>Feng Xiao listened and heaved a
long side, “Master Taoist Cui, you are obviously beside me, and you have not
left for a second, but the fact that you can plot such a huge scheme to mislead
me is really commendable!” </p><p>Although they were sitting in a
very tight space, Cui Buqu’s mood was feeling not bad at all, even his lips
curled into a wicked smile.</p><p>“Did you not also guessed that Wen
Liang is only a smokescreen?”</p><p>Feng Xiao sighed again. “If I am
not wrong, Fo Er’s target was not supposed to be me, but you.”</p><p>Since the Khan Apa held the
intention to side with the Sui Empire, even if they weren’t allies, they would
still become partners. All across Turk, the other countries would be aware and
spread news all around. It is impossible for Khan Ishbara to not hear of
anything. Fo Er, as the number one fighter under the banner of Khan Ishbara,
this time his mission to the Central Plains was obvious.</p><p>He was uninterested in the jade,
but put all his strength into killing Feng Xiao, this can only have one
explanation, and that is he misunderstood that Feng Xiao was the ambassador
sent by the Sui Empire to Khan Apa. This time, his mission is to prevent the
meeting, and to do that, obviously, was to kill Feng Xiao. Once Feng Xiao is
dead, it would shatter both the Sui Empire and other parts of Turk, warning
them of the abilities of Khan Ishbara and causing fear among them.</p><p>He would never guess that the
ambassador sent to meet with Khan Apa’s ambassador was not Feng Xiao, but Cui
Buqu.</p><p>Second Commander Feng of the House
of Blades was bombastic in his actions, so he was mistook as the target
instead.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Since we are both
subjects of the Crown, where is the difference of whether he was targeting you
or me? If we really want to discuss about it, Second Commander Feng you drugged
me with the Naihe drug and caused me to suffer so, this is another incident to
be taken into account.”</p><p>Feng Xiao waved his hand
innocently, “If you told me your identity early, how would you need to go
through such suffering?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “If I had told you
earlier, you would be even more suspicious of me and thwart me in every way,
how would I be able to get the important leads from you?”</p><p>They both glared at each other.</p><p>After a while, Feng Xiao finally
said, “How would you like to work together?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “These few days, Khan
Apa’s ambassador would arrive in the City of Six Crafts. You help me distract
Fo Er and other assassins that might come, do not let them disrupt the
meeting.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Sure. Then about the
lead you’re saying?”</p><p>Cui Buqu told him everything Qiao
Xian and the others had found out, “Qin Miaoyu is very likely a Goguryeon, and
the jade is with her.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “How did you find out?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “If she was skilled in
martial arts from the beginning, she would have already escaped when she
murdered the Khotan ambassador, there is no need to hide within the city. Both
my subordinates fought her together, and yet she still managed to escape. This
can only mean that her martial arts increased greatly within a short amount of
time, and now she wanted to take a shot.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The Jade of Heaven’s
Lake.”</p><p>Cui Buqu nodded, “Only the jade
possessed the legend of being able to greatly amplify a person’s martial arts
within ten days. Now she carries a wound, it would be impossible for her to
exit the city within the night. Once you return, gather your men and search the
entire city. It would not be difficult to find her.”</p><p>Feng Xiao remained silent, “With
the level of her skills a few days ago, it is impossible for her to assassinate
Yuchi Jinwu and his company.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “But she took the jade
and ran away alone. This proves that her accomplish might also be looking for
her. The jade that the Linlang Alliance sold, is very likely put out by her
accomplish, but not to bait us, the bait is for Qin Miaoyu.”</p><p>Feng Xiao added, “Since Qin Miaoyu
already discovered that the jade could greatly increase a person’s martial arts
level, she knows that the one she is holding in her real one, and would not
take the bait.</p><p>With one sentence following after
the next, very quickly they managed to complete the whole story.</p><p>So not only do they have to find
Qin Miaoyu, but they also need to search for her accomplish, to wrap up
everything together.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “How about that Gao
Ning, what is his background?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “That man might have no
connections to the case, perhaps someone is unconvinced of Qin Miaoyu, so they
sent Gao Ning as a reassurance. If you are suspicious, it does no harm to
investigate him.”</p><p>“En.” Feng Xiao turned a little,
“QuQu, since you were under orders to receive the Khan’s ambassador, surely
your place in the Zuoyue Bureau is not low? Since you already know my identity,
should you also not tell me your true identity? After all, we are no longer
outsiders.”</p><p><i>Who is
not an outsider with you?</i> Cui Buqu snorted coldly, glaring
at Feng Er.</p><p>However, he looked calm and
peaceful on the surface, as if he was pondering deeply, “Since we are here now,
I will tell you. In reality, my real surname is not Cui, and my real name is
not Buqu.”</p><p>“Oh?” Feng Xiao’s interest rose
expectantly.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “My surname is Zhangsun,
name Bodhi, I am a Vice Commander of the Zuoyue Bureau.”</p><p>In a certain place in the city,
Zhangsun Bodhi could not stop himself from sneezing.</p>
