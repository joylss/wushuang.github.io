</p><h2>Chapter 17 – Accursed Show-off Oleander</h2><br><br>

<p>Zhangsun
Bodhi is not a man who sought entertainment.</p><p>His
personality, from the eyes of spectators, looked a little bitter. When he was
in the Zuoyue Alliance, he would recite menu scripts or make tea. His life was
even dryer than that of normal monks. However, to him, it did not feel bitter,
in fact, it felt natural.</p><p>At
that moment, every man in the city would have loved to be in his position.
Watching Yunyun dance to the slow music, her legs long and fair and soft. As
they moved, the golden bells on her legs jingled. However, Zhangsun did not act
unnaturally. He sat with his back straight and relaxed, both hands on each
other, the prayer beads sitting in his palm. All his attention was given to the
performance in front of him, as if he was watching one of the best martial
artists performing.</p><p>Lady
Yunyun had also seen many different times of situation, so she could finish a
dance perfectly even under his gaze.</p><p>“Was
it perfect?” She took the cloth given to her by her maidservants and replied as
she laughed. </p><p>“It
was.” Zhangsun only replied two words. However, they sounded even more sincere
compared to a thousand compliments in her ears.</p><p>“Then
tonight, you……” Yunyun only said four words and did not continue.</p><p>Originally
it wasn’t the first time she let a guest stay overnight, but not knowing why,
this time it was difficult for her to express her words. Perhaps because Zhangsun’s
expression looked too formal, he did not look like men who would share a bed
with prostitutes.</p><p>Although
the people outside praised and glorified her and spoke of her as though she was
even more difficult to be bought than gold, but Yunyun knew it in her heart
that, at the end of the day, she is just another person who had no choice in
life, like a fish that struggled fruitlessly in a fisherman’s net.</p><p>Suddenly,
the other man got closer to her and the façade that she put up immediately
crumbled. Her shoulders became stiff, and her body suddenly refused to listen
to her. She wanted to step back, but was unable to. She could only let the
other’s nose drift near her.</p><p>“The
scent on you is very special. Unique.” Zhangsun said.</p><p>Yunyun’s
ears turned red. “Yes, it’s the smell of mandarins, added with a little bit of
the smell of trees and grass.”</p><p>Zhangsun,
“It is a pleasant smell.”</p><p>Both
of them practically stuck close to each other. Yunyun’s waist and shoulders
were held by strong arms, she could not move, but her heart beat gradually
became faster.</p><p>This
man, to her, was even more handsome than any other man she had met. He is
filled with energy and they had shared such an odd fate together.</p><p>Zhangsun,
“Are you the one who made this perfume?”</p><p>Under
her seduction, Lady Yunyun seemed to have lost all her guard, “No. Someone made
it for me.”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi, “Could you make one for me too?”</p><p>“Sure……”
Yunyun stuttered before feeling herself being let go suddenly. Confusion
appeared on her face.</p><p>Zhangsun,
“It not yet dark.”</p><p>Yunyun’s
face turned red. It’s really not that appropriate to do that in the morning. Besides,
the place they’re in is not like the rest. In front of this man, she wanted to
give him a good impression.</p><p>“Then,
my lord, what would you like to do? Should I dance another one for you?” She
combed her hair and smiled gently.</p><p>“I
want to make a painting of you.” Zhangsun Bodhi said.</p><p>Yunyun
was stunned.</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi, “I’ve watched dances in the palace. You do not fall behind compared to
them. I want to put it onto paint and paper, so you can see so yourself.”</p><p>Had
it been any other person who said those words, she would only offer a smile,
but the man who said these words now is someone who paid a lot of attention,
and his look was also very serious. She trusted his words completely.</p><p>No
one had ever said they wanted to paint her.</p><p>Yunyun
raised her head and gave a very exuberant laugh, “Of course!”</p><p>Outside
the room,<b> Hong Zhu </b>and food came,
but the room’s doors were closed and there was only silence.</p><p>Her
footsteps stopped, bringing a little bit of excitement, using a shoulder she
parted the doors a little, looking through the translucent veil. However, it
was not as she has imagined it. There was no music nor action. Yunyun’s back
was turned towards her, unmoving.</p><p>Looking
at the man who just bulged inside just now. They were not kissing or hugging,
but he was standing in front of the study, drawing something.</p><p>Hong
Zhu looked at Zhangsun Bodhi’s drawing for a good long while, envy obvious in
her eyes. However, the two people in the room were oblivious, as if they did
not notice the maidservant eavesdropping outside.</p><p>In
the end, she felt disinteresting, twitching her lips, she quietly left,
bringing the wine and food back to her own room. She was not aware that behind her,
a white shadow appeared.</p><p>Qiao
Xiao originally wanted to question her, but after she observed her, she decided
against it.</p><p>Everyone
has weaknesses. The scariest thing is not being able to find out your enemy’s
weaknesses.</p><p>Hong
Zhu’s weakness is already enough obvious to the eye.</p><p>Or,
if they changed the way they questioned her, the effect would have been far
more effective.</p><p>…….</p><p>In
the Qiushan manor, Cui Buqu stared at the Jade of Heaven’s lake and spoke
warmly, “The present King of Goguryeo its fifty-second ruler. The surname ‘Gao’
is the imperial surname of the Goguryeoians. Although there are few in the
Central Place who knows of Gao Ning, in Goguryeo, he’s no little fella. They
say his sword style is nigh unparalleled. Once, he defeated the top twelve martial
artists from Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. The king was satisfied with his
performance and knight him as the number one martial artist of Goguryeo. He was
permitted to carry his sword and mount horses within the palace.”</p><p>Just
now, after being trolled by Cui Buqu, Pei Jingzhe felt a little salty in his
heart, so he could not help himself saying, “Goguryeo is a small kingdom. It is
rare even to meet them. I fear that the so-called ‘top martial artist’ is
simply just for their standards, but within the Central Plains, they are no
match for anyone.”</p><p>It
was odd to find Cui Buqu agreeing with him, “Not bad. However, this time, Gao
Ning really did have the intention of taking the Jade of Heaven’s Lake. There
are no martial artist in this world that would refuse an opportunity to improve
themselves. Many others were cornered like a bottle’s neck, unable to move up
or down, but with the jade, they might have a chance at a breakthrough.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “But this one is just a saying, there is no way for anyone to know
whether it’s real or a bogus.”</p><p>“A
silver of hope would suffice. People will take the chance.” Feng Xiao knuckled
the table, “Now back to the main topic. Do you all feel that, if you wanted to
steal something, would you allow it to appear in front of the eyes of public,
so it would garner the attention of everyone else?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “I would use the Linlang Alliance’s influence, let it become one of
the auction items, and take it away just like that. Since it came from Linlang
Alliance’s auction event, on the way out it would also be a lot more
convenient. The chairman of the Linlang Alliance, Wen Liang, is still in prison
now, so it is possible. Could it be because Wen Liang was captured by us, their
plans failed, so only the jade was able to fall into our hands?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao shook his head. He thought that the whole matter would not have been so
simple. There is something that he must have left out.</p><p>This
case looked simple on the surface: a murder and robbery case. However, it could
be dissected from within, then one would find that it is even more complicated
than it originally was. It was as if they’ve found a clue, but was immediately
thrown back into chaos. </p><p>Feng
Xiao could feel that someone was playing the chess with an invisible hand. Some
hands had the intention to cover its goals, some hands wanted to observe from
the side.</p><p>As
he thought of this, he turns towards Cui Buqu.</p><p>The
latter felt his gaze on him, so he looked towards his way, looked impassive.</p><p><i>Damn sly fox.</i> Feng Xiao muttered in his heart.</p><p><i>Accursed show-off oleander.</i> Cui Buqu smiled darkly.</p><p>An
oleander, beautiful on the outside and poisonous on the inside, using it on
Feng Xiao, he thought, was definitely far from inappropriate.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe did not realise the intense stare between the two men in front of him.
He thought about it for half a day and said, “Could it be, that there were
originally two Jade of Heaven’s Lake: one bogus one, and there is another real
one?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Hong Zhu: </b>Technically, her name means ‘Red Candle’ but I’m
keeping the pinyin since in this case, it is a human’s alias/name.</p>
