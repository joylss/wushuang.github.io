<h2>Chapter 25 – Lord Feng You Certainly Don’t Look Like Someone Who Is So Benevolent! </h2><br><br>
<p>It
was exactly because she parted her lips to speak, Qiao Xian and Zhangsun
naturally leaned forwards a little bit, but Lady Miao raised both her sleeves
suddenly and two narrow arrows flew out from them, their tips coloured with
something blue and black, as if it was tipped with poison.</p><p>Both
of them received a shock and immediately leap away. Zhangsun’s reflexes were
quick as he shot out a bead, intending to stop Lady Miao, but the latter was
quicker than he imagined. As she floated into the air, she immediately
disappeared from where she stood, and in the blink of an eye she was already a
few miles away.</p><p>“Stop
her!” Qiao Xian urged.</p><p>Without
being told, Zhangsun Bodhi flew over and threw a palm, investing all of his
strength. Lady Miao’s back was facing him, so she was wide open. The palm that
Zhangsun threw contained a hundred percent of his strength hit her square, but
it was surprising that she did not fell, instead she continued forwards.</p><p>Zhangsun’s
attack failed, so he inhaled against to give another chase, but he had lost the
opportunity. The other is already out of his sights.</p><p>“What
happened!” Very quickly, Qiao Xian rushed here.</p><p>Everything
happened in an instant, but both of them never though that something they
thought were already in their hands would just fly off like that.</p><p>“Just
now she was hiding her true strength.” Zhangsun said in a low voice. Ever since
the other took his palm just like that, he had already guessed the reason
behind it.</p><p>“It
cannot be!” Qiao Xian said without even thinking twice, “If that is the case,
why couldn’t she win against the assassin?”</p><p>“There
are two reasons. One, she knew we were here and wanted to bait us into telling
her who we are and where we are from, and who sent us to save her, so there was
no need for her to be afraid. Two, we can be conversed with, and confess that
we are not here to take her life, so she would have leftover strength to escape
from us.”</p><p>It
was rare to see Zhangsun speaking so much, but Qiao Xian would rather him to be
scarce with words. At least they wouldn’t have to watch such an important lead
running away like that.</p><p>But
since Lady Miao ran away, it would be even more difficult to look for her.</p><p>“Now
we can only report back to the Commander.” Qiao Xian said.</p><p>Zhangsun
remained silent, because he did not have a better plan.</p><p>He
said, “Just now she took a hit from me, although she had escaped, she is definitely
injured.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “Even if she wanted to slip out of the city, it would not be easy. If we
wanted to arrange soldiers to patrol the city, we would need to relay our
identities to the House of Blades. It would affect the Commander’s scheme.”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi, “It would not.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “Why?”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi, “I heard that the Khan Ishbara’s number one fighter, Fo Er, came here.
He definitely came for the Commander.”</p><p> Of course they did not know that just tonight,
just now, Fo Er and Feng Xiao had just fought a battle.</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “Then we need to protect the Commander!”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi, “No need. With the House of Blades present, the Commander should be
safe. But with Fo Er present, the Khan’s men would have also arrived. We cannot
give more trouble to the House of Blades.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian inhaled, “You mean that—“ </p><p>The
House of Blades and the Zuoyue Alliance had always minded their own business.
This time would not be any exception. Since Cui Buqu brought people from the
Zuoyue Alliance to the City of Six Crafts, naturally, he has no intention of
getting in the way of the House of Blades. On the other hand, it was only after
hearing of the murder of the Khotan ambassador and the jade’s disappearance,
only did Cui Buqu changed his plans and wanted to get involved in Feng Xiao’s
investigation. If the Zuoyue Alliance could find the jade, then they would have
earned another score in their book.</p><p>However,
ever since Fo Er’s appearance, there’s a change of situations. The important
things needs to be prioritized, and the jade can temporarily be set aside.
Although Lady Miao had escaped, this is still a lead. Instead of letting the
House of Blades walk around in circles, Cui Buqu will definitely choose to use
this piece of information to trade terms with Feng Xiao and earn his
cooperation.</p><p>What
Zhangsun Bodhi mean is that, with Cui Buqu’s cunningness, it would definitely
be more beneficial for the Zuoyue Alliance.</p><p>Qiao
Xian nooded, “Then we should sent word to the Commander.”</p><p>Zhangsun
Bodhi raised his head and saw a piece of grey cloud, concealing the illuminous
light of the moon.</p><p>Their
heads were also concealed by a dark shadow.</p><p>Both
of them already knew what needs to be done. Without speaking more, they went
their separate ways.</p><p>……</p><p>There
are very few people who could wound Feng Xiao. It was shocking that Cui Buqu,
as one who did not even know any martial arts and might not even have the same
strength as a normal person, could accomplish such a feat. It made Pei Jingzhe
open his eyes.</p><p>Feng
Xiao can ignore whether Cui Buqu was hungry or not, but he cannot ignore the
fact that he would be going with such a stain on his clothes. In the end, he
had no choice but to send Pei Jingzhe ahead to the Lu manor, while he brought
Cui Buqu back to the Qiushan manor to change into a set of clean clothes.</p><p>On
the way, Feng Xiao’s footsteps were like floating in the air, as if he used all
the skills he’d learned in his life to rush back. He wasn’t even so determined
back when he was battling with Fo Er.</p><p>The
gengfu preparing to hit the gong only saw a black shadow passing by. He hadn’t
even manage to see clearly, and it was already gone, it left him shocked and
astonished, feeling like he’d just seen a ghost.</p><p>Cui
Buqu also did not feel any better. Just now he was held hostage by the Yu Xiu
Monk, first, he had half his shoulder numb, and now he was held on his other
side as they rushed on the road. He also practically lost all feeling on his
other shoulder.</p><p>But
in these kind of situation, being able to disgust Feng Xiao, Cui Buqu felt that
it was worth it.</p><p>“Looking
very happy about yourself, aren’t you, Master Cui?” Feng Xiao smiled stiffly as
his voice floated into his ear.</p><p>Cui
Buqu took back the curl at the corner of his lips, “I am only happy for
Commander Feng. You have found a new lead on the case, needless to say, the
case will be solve very soon.” </p><p>Feng
Xiao snorted and felt lazy to pay him any more attention.</p><p>But
to Cui Buqu, the snort sounded like it could mean a few meanings.</p><p>One:
once I have changed my clothes, I will have my revenge.</p><p>Two:
Now that you are in my hands, how dare you do this, are you tired of living?</p><p>Three:
I will make you beg for death and cry for your parents, and make you regret
that you sauntered in the mortal world.</p><p>But,
so what?</p><p>Cui
Buqu smiled slightly, not feeling even a little bit afraid.</p><p>Once
they arrived at the Qiushan manor, Feng Xiao threw him aside, and quickly rush
into the manor to shower and change his clothes.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not know any martial arts, bringing only a sickly body, even if he
wanted to escape, he couldn’t go far. Additionally, there are patrols of the
House of Blades within the manor. Feng Xiao did not even need to worry that Cui
Buqu would be so foolish as to try to run away—Cui Buqu, of course, would not
escape either. He went back to his own room and washed himself and asked for
some dumplings from the maids.</p><p>The
fire was already put out, so it would be difficult to start another fire.
However, it wasn’t difficult to make a few dumplings. The maids were quick and
skilled, and very quickly she brought the dumplings as well as a piece of
information for him.</p><p>“The
lead that you gave, Lady Qiao and the rest was unable to catch the person,
please give us new orders on what to do.”</p><p>The
maid was called Tang Li, it was only after she joined the manor that the
housekeeper changed her name. Originally, she was called Lady Tao. It suited
her looks, one that did not made he stand out among the others.</p><p>After
Beijing sent Feng Xiao to escort the Khotan ambassador, Cui Buqu could guess
that the Country Magistrate Zhao would empty this manor for Feng Xiao to use.
So Tang Li also faked poverty and was conveniently sold into the manor to serve
as a maid.</p><p>Originally
she wasn’t the maid for Cui Buqu, but because the maid that usually took care
of Cui Buqu had a stomach pain and vomited to the point of not being able to
leave her bed, the housekeeper reassigned Tang Li, who was always dutiful and
obedient, to Cui Buqu.</p><p>As
to whether she was dutiful and obedient only in front of the housekeeper, or
whether she had always been dutiful and obedient, was no longer important.</p><p>Feng
Xiao and Pei Jingzhe were busy investigating the case, they would not have paid
any attention to such meticulous matters such as a change of servant, so Tang
Li would easily bring the news from Qiao Xian to Cui Buqu.</p><p>Cui
Buqu was souse in deep though, an ice-cold glimmer reflected on his fact, as if
the news was quite attractive to him.</p><p>Tang
Li only spared a glance before lowering her head. </p><p>Although
the guests that came to this manor were elegant and graceful, but compared to
thousands of phoenixes or peacocks, she had instead found that people like
Commander Cui was more pleasant to the eye. </p><p>Only
that he looked a little sickly on the face.</p><p>“Did
you sustain a wound? Do you want me to fetch some medicine?” Tang Li asked.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Do you know how to massage? Both my shoulders are a little sore.”</p><p>Tang
Li, “I can try.”</p><p>As
she walked behind Cui Buqu, she tried to press her fingers lightly on different
spots of his back.</p><p>“You
hurt your tendons, as for your bones, they are alright. The massage would hurt
a little bit.”</p><p>“You
only need to massage. I will take care of standing the pain.” Cui Buqu said in
a relaxed voice.</p><p>Tang
Li did not hesitate and begin to massage for him as she relayed the report.</p><p>When
she reached the point where Lady Miao said something strange to Qiao Xian and
Zhangsun, and figured out that they did not understand before switching to
Chinese, Cui Buqu told her to pause.</p><p>“What
did she say, did she tell you?”</p><p>“She
did.” Tang Li nodded her head. People who can become a member of the Zuoyue
Alliance were intelligent to a certain extent, so she repeated the words that
Lady Miao had said. Although the sentence had been passed from Qiao Xian to
her, she managed to repeat it almost eight to nighty percent of it.</p><p>Cui
Buqu suddenly straightened his back, even when Tang Li accidentally pressed too
hard he had simply ignored it.</p><p>“Commander?”</p><p>“This
is the language of Goguryeo.” Cui Buqu said, “Qin Miaoyu is a Goguryeon, and
the Jade of Heaven’s Lake is definitely with her.”</p><p>Why
would he think so?</p><p>Tang
Li was very curious, but she did not continue asking, because everything Cui
Buqu did would have a reason, and if it was not her place to ask, she would not
ask in the first place.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not continue speaking. On the other hand, Feng Xiao had finished
showering and sent people to call for Cui Buqu. After Cui Buqu ate a few
dumplings and felt better about his shoulders, he stood up and headed to where
Feng Xiao was.</p><p>But
Feng Xiao’s face did not look any better just because he had changed into a new
set of clothes.</p><p>He
held a letter in his hand and a token. On the letter there were only a few
words, mentioning that Pei Jingzhe was held hostage and wanted Feng Xiao to
head to the Huyang Forest. The token is a token carried by all members of the
House of Blades, the same one Pei Jingzhe took it with him at all times. If the
token was lost, then it could only mean that the other party was not lying.</p><p>It
was very obvious that the enemy’s target was not Pei Jingzhe, but Feng Xiao,
and perhaps even the Jade of Heaven’s Lake.</p><p>“Never
mind about failure, this is giving me trouble!” Feng Xiao could not help but
scolded.</p><p>“Fo
Er?” Cui Buqu offered.</p><p>“Perhaps.”
He swirled his fingers, turning that letter into dust and let it disappear in
the wind.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “You are planning to go?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Why not?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu looked surprised, “Lord Feng you certainly don’t look like someone so
benevolent, who knew you would even care about the life of a subordinate!”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “His father saved me before.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu shook his head, “It still does not seem like you.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Then what should I do according to you?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Write a reply: If you want to kill him, do it.”</p>
