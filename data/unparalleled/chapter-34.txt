<h2>Chapter 34 – Would The House Of Blades Have Someone As Crafty As Myself?</h2>
<br><br>

<p>Lu Ti was held hostage,
his life was currently in danger, and his face was even more shaken with the
look of surprise, fear, and disbelief.</p><p>“<b>San Lang</b>, let go of your Uncle!” Madam Lu cried.</p><p>“You animal! When did
your Aunt and I treated you badly, why did you kill our daughter!” Lu Ti shook
all over, he could not even care about the sword on his neck, blood followed
the edge of the blade, trickling down. Madam Lu was unable to accept this
truth, a wave of darkness washed over her eyes, and she suddenly fell to the
ground.</p><p>Su Xing, “My apologies,
even if you people treated me better, I have not forgotten my own family, so I
cannot become the real Su Xing!”</p><p>Not only Lu Ti, even Cui
Buqu and his companions, could not help the look of shock that spread across
their faces.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “If you are
not Su Xing, then who are you?”</p><p>Su Xing remained silent.</p><p>Lu Ti was hurt even more,
“Even if you are not Su Xing, you were in the Lu manor for a few years, I have
no sons, I’ve viewed you as one of my own, and my daughter—she was faithful and
devoted to you, her love has never wavered. This time, the marriage to the
Taiyuan royal family, until the end, it was my fault. It had nothing to do with
my daughter. Even if you were furious, why did you not take vengeance on me,
but killed her instead! You, do you not have any conscience!?”</p><p>Su Xing sighed a breath,
“You are mistaken. This is not the reason behind, why I chose to kill her. Her
death was because of her own fault for being at the wrong place at the wrong
time that got herself killed!”</p><p>Cui Buqu suddenly said,
“She found out that you were a Goguryeon, or did she find out that you were the
murderer of the Khotan ambassador, the one who stole the Jade of Heaven’s
Lake?”</p><p>Su Xing squinted his eyes
at him for a moment, and said suddenly, “It is as expected of the House of
Blades, I originally thought no one would find out, and I could leave quietly,
who knew that murdering a wealthy lady would draw so much trouble!”</p><p>Cui Buqu laughed coldly,
“Would the House of Blades have someone as crafty as myself? I am from the
Zuoyue Bureau, remember that, the two characters that form the right half of
the word ‘Sui’, don’t recognize your enemy wrongly, and be a clueless ghost
when you arrive in hell!” </p><p>Pe Jingzhe: ……</p><p>He could see that, the
‘House of Blades’ is a name used to offend others and make enemies all around
the world, and the ‘Zuoyue Bureau’ is a name used to establish his dominance
upon his enemies and send fear down their spines.</p><p>But why did he have to
make the House of Blades sound low and sleazy? And the Zuoyue Bureau sound high
and mighty, a tier above others?</p><p>He felt this was unfair
and despicable, but this is not the time to throw a fit, so he could only
suppress his displeasure and swallow it down, making a note in his mind to
return to the House of Blades later and repeating everything back to Feng Xiao.</p><p>Since in this situation
now, other than Pei Jingzhe himself, no one would discern all the words going
around in his heart, because everyone was captivated by the conversation
between Su Xing and Cui Buqu.</p><p>Lu Ti especially, shook
all over, “You… You are a Goguryeon?! Where is the original Su Xing!”</p><p>“He was dead a long time
ago.” Su Xing said, “Six years ago, Su Xing and his family met with a plague,
all five of them died from the incident. I happened to pass by, so I used his
identity and pretended to flee for my life, hence I came to the Lu manor.”</p><p>Lu Ti inhaled strongly,
“Why, why the Lu family! The Lu family has nothing to do with Goguryeo!”</p><p>Su Xing, “Whether as the
Lu family’s son-in-law, or just Su Xing, it is but only an empty shell, an
identity. Wherever they want me to be, there I will be, who they want me to be,
that person I will be.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe quickly, “Who
is them?!”</p><p>Su Xing did not pay him
any attention he continued saying, “After I settled down in the Lu family, no
one contacted me, originally I also thought, I could marry Lady Lu and become
Su Xing for real, it was not so bad. But it was a pity, the Khotan ambassador
came forth and wanted to see the Sui Emperor, news arrived here quickly, and
they finally contacted me, so I am unable to stay away.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “Then what
has it to do with you murdering the Lady Lu Si? She is just a girl, completely
incomparable to those you ally yourself with!”</p><p>Lu Ti wailed, “I also
want to know! Su Xing, I care not whether you are called Su Xing or not, these
years, you were never badly treated in the Lu family, your Aunt even thought
that people would look down on you, she even ordered them to treat you like
they would to Lady Lu, and my daughter felt towards you, is even more…… why,
why, why!”</p><p>Cui Buqu said coldly,
“Does this need to be asked? Lady Lu and the Khotan ambassador shared no
connection, it must be that she had found out about it, and forced Su Xing to
quickly exterminate the witness!”</p><p>Su Xing, “That is
correct. That day Lady Lu came from her father’s and immediately searched for
me. Coincidentally, I wasn’t in my room. She had always been very respectful,
but that time, before she have my permission, she rushed into my study.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “People like
you always needed to be meticulous and careful, otherwise it is impossible for
you to pretend for so many years and was undiscovered. After Lady Lu Si entered
your study, what did she see that she wasn’t supposed to see?”</p><p>“I have a book, written
full of codes, with these codes, I can read the encoded messages sent by my
accomplices. That book was originally not very obvious, during normal days, no
one would even look at it, but that day she happened to take it from so many
other books from the shelf.”</p><p>Su Xing blinked. He could
have originally chose not to say much, he could have been silent, then Cui Buqu
and his people might not have been able to find out what happened to Lady Lu
that got her killed, but as he spoke, it was obvious that Lady Lu’s love for
him was not completely one-sided.</p><p>But she was already dead,
so he could only use this opportunity to vent, to sooth that little regret in
his heart.</p><p>“After I returned and saw
her look of panic, I went to check on the book and realized it really had been
flipped open before. With her cleverness, she might have already know what it
is. I have yet to find the jade, so I cannot afford my identity to be
discovered, so, Lady Lu has to die.” He inhaled a breath.</p><p>Lu Ti’s face has long
since become splotchy with tears, and these tears, were tears of extreme fury,
it is the face of a father facing his beloved daughter’s murderer, but also a
face of someone completely helpless.</p><p>“My daughter loved you
with her whole heart. She could even reject a betrothal to the Yuantai royal
family. Whatever happened, she would not have betrayed you, why couldn’t you
let her live!”</p><p>Su Xing insisted, “I
cannot afford to take this risk. If my identity is exposed, my mission would
fail, my only relative in Goguryeo would die. This love that Lady Lu entrusted
to me, I could only owe her this debt, and repay it in another life.”</p><p>He turned towards Cui
Buqu and the others, “By this time, you should already know that the Jade of
Heaven’s Lake is not with me. If I use Lu Ti’s life and an important
information to exchange for my freedom, would you let me go?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe snorted, “You
mean your accomplice? She is heavily injured and we are searching for her
throughout the city, she will be caught in the blink of an eye.”</p><p>Su Xing shook his head,
“Only I know where she would hide, without me, even if you searched the city
for three days and night, you would not find her. Don’t forget, the jade is with
her right now, with her intellect, she would have already discovered that the
jade can enhance one’s martial arts, and even heal any injuries she had. Once
her injuries are healed, she can blend in and leave the city. If you want to
catch her then, it would only be more difficult.”</p><p>As he spoke his gaze
never left Cui Buqu, it was obvious that he knew, Cui Buqu was the one in
charge.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Deal. If your information
is genuine, I can drop the case of Lady Lu’s murder, if you do not believe me,
you can keep Lu Ti first, and release him at the end of the deal.”</p><p>Lu Ti tore his throat
coughing, “Impossible! Even if he drops the case, I will never let you go, I
will definitely kill you!”</p><p>Su Xing did not put his
words to heart, sealing Lu Ti’s throat, so he would shut up.</p><p>“I need something to
secure this mutual agreement.” Su Xing told Cui Buqu.</p><p>Cui Buqu turned towards
Zhangsun Bodhi, “You go help Feng Xiao, no need to come back first, I will call
for you when I need you.”</p><p>Zhangsun nodded, did not
ask more, turned around and left.</p><p>Su Xing watched the other
leave with his own eyes and released a breath of relief.</p><p>He himself is a master of
the martial arts, among everyone present, Zhangsun Bodhi was the only one that
he was aware of. Once Zhangsun left, no one present was his match, so Su Xing
has no need to fear.</p><p>Cui Buqu reached out to
Pei Jingzhe, “Give it to me.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, ???</p><p>Cui Buqu said
impatiently, “Your Lord allowed me to help, surely he would given you something
as proof that you bring his word? Now is the time to use it, go give it to me!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was
displeased and unsatisfied, he couldn’t help but asked, “But are you not the
Zuo……”</p><p>Midway he spoke, Cui Buqu
glared at him with a dark gaze, Pei Jingzhe paused and said nothing more, his
hand reaching into his pocket to fish out a small and fine seal, throwing it
over to Cui Buqu. </p><p>Cui Buqu lowered his head
to inspect the seal, then tossing it over to Su Xing.</p><p>“This is the seal of the
Second Commander of the House of Blades. It is recognize by men across the city
and the Sui Empire, you can gain entry no matter where you go. With such an
item in your hand, it should suffice?”</p><p>Su Xing had a deep
history, and had lived in the Lu manor for five to six years, he knew the seal
was the real thing and fiddled with it as it sat in his hands, at the very
least he knew that the other wasn’t lying to him. Placing the seal into his
pocket, he held Lu Ti and walked slowly out of the room.</p><p>All the Lu manor’s
inhabitants shouted at him like he was a mortal enemy of theirs, but Su Xing
put none of that to heart.</p><p>He had no idea why, even
though Cui Buqu did not know any martial arts and therefore could not fight,
but from this distance, he felt like the other’s threat was even greater than
Pei Jingzhe and Qiao Xian who were both capable fighters.</p><p>This is the instinct of
one who practiced the martial arts.</p><p>It was impossible to
explain, and it could not be understood, but it was even more accurate than
anything could compare.</p><p>Once he and Lu Ti were
far enough from Cui Buqu, and he would leave on his own, he said, “Qin Miaoyu
has three places she often goes to in the city: <b>The Spring Moon</b>, the <b>Ronghe
Zai</b>, and another place, is the <b>Blue
Bricks Manor</b>, a phrase ‘Green Willow Autumn Light’ is pasted on the door,
with red bricks that looked new and fresh.”</p><p>Qiao Xian did found Qin
Miaoyu in the Spring Moon, so once she heard Su Xing’s words, she knew that he
wasn’t lying.</p><p>Su Xing inhaled and Lu Ti
was unwillingly dropped on the roof.</p><p>“I have said what I
promised to say, so I am leaving now.” Su Xing laughed.</p><p>He was not
extraordinarily handsome, but once he escaped danger, a charisma seems to fill
his entire person. From this angle, the reason Lady Lu fell for him was not
completely unreasonable. It was a pity that fate would not have them together,
and she had misplaced her life.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I still have a
question.”</p><p>Su Xing, “Master Taoist
Cui, you are too greedy. I will not answer you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Since you are
not called Su Xing, how should I address you?”</p><p>Su Xing remained silent
for a moment, “Yin Zairong, as in <b>a man’s
value is in his efforts, not his looks</b>.”</p><p>“Perhaps it meant ‘in
morals not in looks’!” Qiao Xian laughed coldly, “Did you know? Last time when
we fought her and she was caught, she rather take the risk and escape instead
of selling you out.”</p><p>By ‘she’, she did not
mean Lady Lu, but Qin Miaoyu.</p><p>Su Xing looked taken
aback.</p><p>At this moment, the wind
picked up from his back.</p><p>He wanted to catch Lu Ti
again, but he did not have enough time to do so, so he could only push him
aside and used that strength to leap aside.</p><p>But it was as if the man
behind him knew his intentions, so he also leap to the other side.</p><p>Su Xing was afraid of
being surrounded by Qiao Xian and the others, so he refused to attack and only focused
on escaping.</p><p>Who knew that his
opponent is incredibly skilled, he rushed to his front and raise a palm, ready
to strike; Su Xing was forced to draw his sword, and as he did this, his head
rose to see a handsome face smiling before him.</p><p>“Why are you in such a
rush? Why don’t you return my seal back to me first?” Feng Xiao smiled.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>San Lang: </b>‘San’ means ‘three’ and ‘Lang’ as spoken before, is used to address a
male. So San Lang can mean that Su Xing is the third child among this siblings.
</p><p><b>The Spring Moon, Ronghe Zai, Blue Bricks Manor:</b> The Spring Moon’s direct Chinese translate should
be the ‘Spring Fragrance’, I did not realize mistranslated it into the Spring
Moon earlier probably because I was too tired when I was translating it for the
first time, however, the Spring Moon is a place equivalent to nightclubs, where
men find entertainment and prostitutes. I am unable to say exactly what are the
Ronghe Zai and Blue Bricks Manor because the meaning Su Xing gave is quite
general, but they aren’t important so it’s okay to leave them here. Maybe in
future I will do some research for details.</p><p><b>A man’s value is in his efforts, not his looks:</b> Su Xing’s real name, the characters ‘Yin’, ‘Zai’
and ‘Rong’ is spread out across this phrase in Chinese.
