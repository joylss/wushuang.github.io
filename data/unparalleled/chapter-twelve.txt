<br><h2>Chapter 12 – This Is My ‘Bosom Friend’, His Surname Is Cui, Name Buqu </h2><br><br>
<p>On the wooden sides of the table,
originally on the spot where Cui Buqu sat, there were two words that were carved
by fingernails: Plum Blossom.</p><p>“Judging by the strength the
Commander asserted to write those words, it seemed as though he was much weaker
than last time. I’m afraid he is carrying some sort of wound on him.”</p><p>The man never liked talking much, however,
he could not help but had to remind her. “Qiao Xian, the Commander knows his
boundaries.”</p><p>Qiao Xian was not as tame as
himself, “You have served the Commander for so long, how can you still not know
him? He knows boundaries when it comes to matters, but he never knew his own
when it came to himself!”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi said nothing, but
looked at her with a ‘<i>But what can you do
about it?</i>’ look.</p><p>Qiao Xian was feeling distressed
but there was nothing really that she could have done.</p><p>Cui Buqu has always been someone who
refused to stop unless he achieved his goals. Right now unless they run off to
Feng Xiao and tell him Cui Buqu’s identity, then bring him back home, their
only other option was to obey his orders. However, if she messed up his plans,
then she knew Cui Buqu would dismiss her from the Zuoyue Alliance.</p><p>So Qiao Xian only let out a sigh.</p><p>“It is late. Let us go to the
perfume shop.” Zhangsun Bodhi reminded her.</p><p>“Let’s go.” Qiao Xian brushed the
surface of the table, and those words disappeared. The side of the table was
clean, as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>There was no shortage of perfume
stalls in the City of Six Crafts.</p><p>Because it is a city that
travellers from the west and east all often met, there were a lot of things in
the perfume shop that could only be found in the west. The variety of products
was even greater than Beijing. Zhangsun Bodhi and Qiao Xian originally thought
that the plum blossom would be a piece of cake, but after they ran around for a
whole afternoon, practically asked every stall that exists in the city, they
only managed to find three formulas that were related to the plum blossom. </p><p>“It’s a coincidence now that I
think about it. Before you, there was also a young lord who came here asking
about plum blossoms. He’s thin and tall, and looked young and handsome.” The
perfume shop owner made a gesture.</p><p>Qiao Xian and Zhangsun Bodhi
exchanged glances and could guess who the perfume shop owner was talking about:
it was Feng Xiao’s subordinate, Pei Jingzhe.</p><p>Since the House of Blades have already
followed this clue, it could be said that there was nothing more they needed to
do. Why did the Commander wanted to go out of their way to give this order?</p><p>Cui Buqu would never do such a
meaningless thing. Both of them also felt that there might be something that
they haven’t thought of yet.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare comment on other
aspects, but within the City of Six Crafts, the formulas in my stalls are
definitely the most organized. If you want formulas related to plum blossoms,
there are three types. One of them was gifted by a young lady from the west
whom I saved, she gave it to me.”</p><p>The perfume shop owner said, and
took out three scented strips.</p><p>The sense of smell of martial
artists were incredibly sensitive. To leave perfume on one self would give
themselves away easily if they were found out. Qiao Xian has a special
identity, so she would never carry any sort of scent on her. For people like
her who interact as less as possible with perfumes, she was even more sensitive
to their scent. Almost at once, she can tell how many different scents there
are altogether. </p><p>“These are plum blossoms and
apricot flowers?” She smelled the scented strips and asked, before passing them
to Zhangsun Bodhi.</p><p>The perfume shop owner nodded.
“You’re right. This is called the Three Moons Spring Snow, it is the most
popular perfume in Beijing. The young maidens all loved it, especially those
from wealthier households. Come spring, they like to put on fresh coloured
clothing, then putting these perfumes on, they say it makes you look like a
goddess. It’s guaranteed that a group of suitors would want to stomp your
doorstep!”</p><p>His tongue was smooth. Even if he
was being questioned by his customers, he was trying to persuade them to
purchase from him.</p><p>“This type is called ‘The Quiet
Waters Runs Deep’, it has the smell of sandalwood and plum blossom. It’s
excellent for giving you a peace of mind and suppress any foul smell of the
body.” He said as he took up another scented strip.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi smelled it and shook
his head.</p><p>Qiao Xian also said, “This is not
the plum blossom scent that we wanted.”</p><p>The perfume shop owner took the
third scented strip and gave it to them, “This is the only one with pure plum
blossom smell.”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi held it in his hand
and felt that the plum blossom smell was so strong, filling in his nostril,
however, it lacked the original cold, icy smell of a plum blossom. Instead, it
smelt like peonies.</p><p>Qiao Xian watched Zhangsun shook
his head and took the scented strip.</p><p>“Sir, you are knowledgeable and
have saw many things. This mix of plum blossom scent, is it really that
difficult to get?”</p><p>The owner of the perfume shop said,
“Usually, the thicker the essence of the smell, the better. But because this is
slightly different: at first the smell should be a bland, cold, icy smell, then
after an hour, only would the smell of plum blossom slowly emerge, yet you can
only smell it’s faint, icy cold scent. It’s neither strong and it doesn’t
dissipate quickly. It could last up to a few days.”</p><p>Qiao Xian thought about the fact
that after the murder took place, Feng Xiao and his company was able to go to
the venue and obtain that clue fits in with this fact perfectly, so she nodded
and agreed.</p><p>“This also means that, those
whoever uses this perfume is surely no ordinary person?”</p><p>The owner, “There are also
different types of ‘cold perfume’. For example, the lotus blossom, the bamboo,
but because plum blossoms only bloom during cold winter, it brought the
icy-cold essence of winter. This type of ‘cold’ is different and very rare. A
few years ago, I obtained a special type of lotus blossom perfume and I was
reluctant to sell it, desiring to leave it as a wedding gift to my daughter,
but this plum blossom is even rarer. Whoever could make this type of perfume
would indeed treasure it so, and would not have gave it away easily. Otherwise,
everyone on the streets would know how to manufacture it, then how will it
still be special?”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “Then do you know anyone
who knew how to manufacture this perfume?”</p><p>The owner of the perfume shop
laughed bitterly, “If I knew, I would have hired them with gold pieces. Would I
still stand here saying so much to you? Strange wonders can be encountered
unexpectedly but cannot be requested. I’ve spent half my life in the perfume
business, so if you found someone who knows how to manufacture that sort of
perfume, please be a generous person and let me know.”</p><p>He stopped for a moment to pat his
own head, “Right, last month, Lady Yunyun from the Spring Moon astounded half
of the city with her dance. I’ve heard that every day she used a different
perfume, yet she has never sent anyone here to purchase from me. Perhaps she
might have someone behind teaching her how to make her own perfume. Nevertheless,
you can head over there and inquire about it!” </p><p>Qiao Xian and Zhangsun Bodhi’s eyes
sparkled. </p><p>“Have you spoke about this to the
one that came before us?” Qiao Xian asked.</p><p>The perfume shop owner took his
head, “At that time, this did not cross my mind. Naturally, I’ve forgotten
about it.”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “That Spring Moon place,
is it a place of entertainment?” </p><p>The perfume shop owner gave a
dubious smile that all men knew.</p><p>Qiao Xian immediately understood
and felt that the question she had used asked was very stupid.</p><p>Broadly speaking, &nbsp;spices used to make perfumes are also a type
of medicine. Since Cui Buqu is familiar with the arts of healing, he is
naturally familiar to spices, and he knew that the plum blossom perfume is very
rare. From this piece of information, he was able to spread out. Qiao Xian and
Zhangsun Bodhi knew their Commander very well. Others may underestimate him,
seeing how he is often sick and that he lacked physical strength. However, if a
person like that can summon winds and storms, making a standing in the world,
then he definitely had something to him normal people wouldn’t be able to
guess. In the Zuoyue Alliance, even if Cui Buqu spent eight out of ten days
lying in bed, no one would dare to underestimate him. </p><p>“Would the members of the House of
Blades vomit blood if they knew that the ‘Five Tastes’ restaurant is our
stronghold?” Qiao Xian felt better after obtaining a possible lead for the
case. Although her face is still expressionless and cold, her voice sounded
less tense. </p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi did not respond to
her but asked her a question back, “The Spring Moon, should you and I go?”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “Of course it should be
me. With a face like yours, people would think you are there to collect debts,
certainly not one for looking for entertainment.”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi held the prayer
beads in his hand, and did not say a word.</p><p>Because, towards Qiao Xian’s words,
there was nothing he could refute.<br>
<br>
</p><p>……</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Linlang Alliance’s Hall.</p><p>Today is the final day of the
auction, compared to the last few days, there were even more people. However,
the threshold was also higher than before. Other than an invitation, customers
also need to give some amount of deposit before entering. If they managed to purchase
something they like, then the deposit would be added to the amount they’d
auctioned for. If nothing caught their eyes, then the deposit would be
returned. </p><p>Therefore, it filtered out a lot of
people who had other intentions, or those who did not really want to make a
purchase and simply wanted to come for the crowd. </p><p>Feng Xiao brought Cui Buqu and Pei
Jingzhe and entered, before someone immediately exclaimed from behind, “Is this
not Feng-Er?”</p><p>That person immediately ran up to
them, both surprised and happy to see Feng Xiao. “Feng-Er, long time no see. To
think I would see you here.”</p><p>The other man looked around
twenty-five to twenty-six, wearing a tall headpiece and red robes. He looked
like an elegant gentleman, but Cui Buqu’s sharp eyes was able to tell that the
way he behaved around Feng Xiao was different from the norm.</p><p>Meeting old friends are a common
thing, but this manner of attentiveness and welcoming was a little off the
hook.</p><p>To think of someone who wanted to
bribe Feng Xiao wasn’t exactly accurate either.</p><p>Just as Cui Buqu thought deeply,
Feng Xiao had already raised his brows and smiled, “Young Master Lin, it has
been some time.”</p><p>When these words left his mouth,
and judging by the other’s age, his background and history was slowly emerging
in Cui Buqu’s mind. </p><p>The Yandang Estate. Among the
Jianghu province, their main profile was doing business. Both rich and wealthy,
their family also possessed the Yandang thirteen sword styles. The head, Lin
Leng, only obtained a son, Lin Wei, in his late years, therefore it was natural
that he spoiled this child rotten. Even towards his son’s bewildered and queer
habits, Lin Leng only remained silent but had never obstructed him. The reason
that the Yandang Estate is so famous isn’t because of their wealth, and not
because of their sword style, but because of Lin Wei.</p><p>Seeing that Lin Wei was all giddy
and happy, practically lunging himself forward to hold Feng Xiao’s hand, the
latter naturally stepped a few inches away from him, his hand reaching up to
place it on Cui Buqu’s shoulder instead. Before Cui Buqu realized it, he was
already pulled towards Feng Xiao’s body, their shoulders clashing against one
another.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Come, let me introduce
to you. This is my ‘bosom friend’. His surname is Cui, named Buqu. QuQu, this
is Young Master Lin of Yandang Estate, Lin Wei.”</p><p>He purposely put more emphasis on
the words ‘bosom friend’, his lips curling into a strange and unusual smile. It
was incredibly suggestive, and plain, that anyone could have seen it.</p><p>

Cui Buqu, “???”
