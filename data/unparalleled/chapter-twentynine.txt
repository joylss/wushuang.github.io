<h2>Chapter 29 – Fuck, How Did I End Up In A Situation Like This</h2><br><br>

<p>As
Feng Xiao listened, he was unamused, the corner of his eyes were turned upwards
as if he was smiling yet it also looked like he wasn’t.</p><p>“How
inconvenient. I have seen the Zuoyue Bureau’s Vice-Commander before, a man and
a woman, do not tell me you are one of them.”</p><p>His
tone was filled with <i>Go on, keep lying,
let’s see how your story goes</i>.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “How would you know the Zhangsun Bodhi you saw was the real Zhangsun
Bodhi?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Oh?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu’s face did not change, but he continue to say nonsense, “As members of the
Zuoyue Bureau, we often have to hide our identities. It is very normal to use
one or two doubles. After all, I only have my brain for an advantage, unlike
Second Commander Feng who excelled in martial arts and could do whatever he
please.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao suspected that Cui Buqu is mocking him for being a simple-minded bloke
with four developed limbs, but Cui Buqu’s tone was very normal and calm, as if
he was impossible to see what he was thinking about.</p><p>“Then
who is the Commander of the Zuoyue Bureau. His surname, and name?”</p><p> “Even I have not seen him. He has never shown
himself. Every time he would stand behind a screen as he spoke to us. His voice
is frail, perhaps he is already an old man.” Cui Buqu babbled on, speaking as
if what he was saying is indeed real.</p><p>Feng
Xiao’s forehead wrinkled, in his heart, he said<i>, could it be that General Zheng who always stood by the Empress and
carried her trust?</i></p><p>“Is
his voice soft and feminine?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Other than he sounded old, there was nothing special about his voice.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao sighed, “Master Taoist Cui, you are such an elegant man with unparalleled
intelligence. It is such a pity that you are beneath another, in the end, it
would be better if you were the one in charge!” </p><p>They were both in a situation such
as this, yet they were still mutually eyeing each other.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Is it not? Just like
Lord Feng yourself, with the Minister of Justice above you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled, “The Minister of
Justice is simply for show. In the end, the House of Blades is different from
the Zuoyue Bureau. Although the Emperor and Empress were seen as the Twin
Holiness, in the end, the country still belong to the Emperor. Between taking
orders from the Emperor or the Emperor’s wife, there is still a stark
difference. Listen to me, that Vice-Commander of yours is nothing. Come to the
House of Blades and be my Fourth Commander, you will be granted the authority
to take action before an imperial degree. Anything the Zuoyue Bureau can give
you, the House of Blades can also give you. And of anything the Zuoyue Bureau
is unable to give you, the House of Blades can also give you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu asked curiously, “If I
defected to the House of Blades, then I would still be under you as I am under
the Commander in the Zuoyue Bureau, so what can the House of Blades give me
that the Zuoyue Bureau could not?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Of course that is
different. How could an old man compare to an elegant, beautiful, unsurpassed
talent like myself?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “If you look at me every
day, you will feel that your mood has lightened and you will have a good mood
throughout the day. Your body would be in such a good condition, you need no
medicine to heal it. Is this not a great benefit?”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Cui Buqu
said suddenly, “Second Commander Feng, you really are the most good-looking man
I have ever seen.”</p><p>Feng Xiao wriggled his eyebrows,
“That goes without saying, did you only acknowledge this today?”</p><p>Cui Buqu then added honestly, “You
are also the most thick-faced man I have ever seen.”</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, “Haha! Of those
who can achieve great conquests in this world, would they be thin-skinned?
Pride is only something that restrained you and thwart you from moving forward.
Just look at that Fo Er. He obviously lost to me, but he insist that I wasn’t
paying attention so he could save his own pride. This is someone who loves
reputation too much, so be it on powers or abilities, he will never be able to
achieve this full potential. For the Khan Ishbara to have someone like this to
do his bidding, I fear it would be difficult for him to achieve anything as
well.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “From what I know of,
although Fo Er is heralded the number one fighter of Turk, but these years Turk
has also yielded many highly skilled fighters that we have lost count. The Khan
Bagha from Western Turk is one himself. Even Khan Apa has someone by the name
of Yelouhe who looked delicate and pretty, but with moves as deadly as a
serpent. These are not people to be belittled….”</p><p> Feng Xiao was listening very intently, but
before the other could finish his sentence, he had already begun coughing. </p><p>Although Cui Buqu covered his
mouth, the sound of his coughs still seeped between his fingers, and very
quickly he was unable to suppress it. His coughing only became more and more
violent. If the assassins from the Yunhai Thirteen Stories weren’t taken out by
Feng Xiao earlier, they would have already been discovered.</p><p>Following his coughs, a mild
soreness and pain begun to radiate from his bones, very quickly spreading to
the rest of his body, to the tips of his fingers and all his organs. Even his
temples were beginning to hurt. These are the symptoms of the Naihe drug taking
effect within him. And since his body was already ill, the pain he experienced
were a hundred more times more painful than normal people.</p><p>Yet, even until his point, other
than the coughing sounds he made, Cui Buqu has never uttered a word of pain.</p><p>The House of Blades had used the
Naihe drug on others before. Feng Xiao once saw, with his own eyes, a supremely
skilled martial artist pushed to tears by the drug. Whatever they asked, he
would answer. Even after the poisoned was neutralized, he had lost half of his
consciousness and his body gradually getting weaker as the drug destroyed it. </p><p>In the end, Cui Buqu was from the
Zuoyue Bureau, they are not mortal enemies, so for them to use the drug on him,
was that a little too much?</p><p>For the first time in his life,
Second Commander Feng reflected on himself.</p><p>But very quickly he pacified these
useless sentiments, convincing himself that it was also because he was wounded
and poisoned, that he pitied the other man.</p><p>“There is some Naihe drug on me.”
He told Cui Buqu.</p><p>“…….I do not need it.” Cui Buqu
curled up into a ball to minimize the cold and at the same time, gathered more
heat.</p><p>There is no remedy for the Naihe
drug. The only remedy was to endure it throughout the process and allow the
poison to neutralize itself, expelling itself out of the body. People who were
trained in martial arts could use their inner strength to suppress the poison,
and other way was to battle poison with poison, using more Naihe drug to suppress
itself, but after suppressing it once, the next time it takes effect would be
twice as painful. However, the one poisoned would drink poison to quench their
thirst. They would rather seek a temporarily, short-term comfortable, and risk
more in the long-term.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The cave is cold and
damp. Your body is already weak to begin with, it will be even more painful
when it takes effect. Take this opportunity now. The next time the poison takes
effect, you may rest in a more comfortable place. Regardless of what, you would
be more comfortable than now.”</p><p>Cui Buqu only felt himself growing
hotter. His consciousness is already beginning to slip, even Feng Xiao’s voice,
was a hair out of reach.</p><p>“If I allow this first exception,
there would be a second time. If I want to solve this permanent, the best way
is to not even allow the first exception to take place.” He closed his eyes
shut, knitting his brows tightly together to balance out the unstoppable ache
and pain. He laughed, “I have endured things more painful than this… this is
nothing.”</p><p>Feng Xiao brows twitched. He wanted
to ask, but hearing how outside, thunder storms rumbled in the sky, small winds
that suddenly spiralled into a huge storm, throwing about snow and rain outside
the cave. Suddenly there was a piercing cold. Once the mouth is opened, it
would feel as if a gust of cold air was poured into the body. Feng Xiao also
found that he himself had begun coughing.</p><p>Once he started coughing, it was as
though he could not stop. The night is long, and both of them were stuck
against each other, coughing in unison, as if they were singing some kind of
song.</p><p>Feng Xiao could hear the sound of
wolves in the distance.</p><p>He twitched his lips and looked at
Cui Buqu who sat a little distance away.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Hey.”</p><p>Cui Buqu was fighting the poison
with all the consciousness left in his body, so he did not pay him any
attention.</p><p>Feng Xiao coughed twice, “I am also
injured. Do you want to come closer? We can sit together and give each other
warmth.”</p><p>Cui Buqu barely opened his eyes and
thought for a moment, only did his brain register his words. </p><p>“You, roll over here.” He said.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “???”</p><p>He saw that Cui Buqu wasn’t moving
at all, so he could guess that the other did not have much strength left, so he
put down his dignity for a spilt moment and pulled the other into his arms, in
his heart he cursed, <i>Fuck, how did I end
up in such a situation?</i></p><p>As he thought, it was all because
of one person.</p><p>Pei. Jing. Zhe.</p><p>……</p><p>Pei Jingzhe stood at the gate of
the Lu manor and sneezed thrice in one go.</p><p>He could not figure out whether he
had caught a cold, or someone was cursing him, because he also encountered an
incident.</p>
