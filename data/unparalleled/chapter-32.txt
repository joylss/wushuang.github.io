<h2>Chapter 32 – You Know Each Other Really Well</h2>
<br><br>

<p>After
he finished listening to the Lu family’s story, Cui Buqu’s yielded a deep
expression.</p><p>Once
Qian Xiao caught that look, she knew that he was deeply interested in the
matter, “You want to interfere in the Lu family’s matters?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “This is a very good opportunity to make the House of Blade split the
glory.”</p><p>Qiao
Xiao had expected him to have given up interfering in the Khotan ambassador’s
murder case, but she did not utter a word.</p><p>“But
Feng Xiao is not a very reliable ally.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “There is no need for me to ask, compared to the Lu family, of course the
most suspicious person to hold the Jade of Heaven’s Lake, Qin Miaoyu, is more
important right now. He needs to busy himself with searching for Qin Miaoyu in
the city, he has no time to meddle with the Lu family’s affair. However, Feng
Xiao knew that Pei Jingzhe is not capable to take care of the Lu family’s
matter, he will definitely order Pei Jingzhe to seek our help.”</p><p>After
he finished speaking, he suddenly felt that his appetite is quite good. Not
only did he finish the chicken soup, he even ate a huge bowl of Yangchun
noodles. </p><p>As
he put the bowl down, news of Pei Jingzhe’s arrival came.</p><p>Qiao
Xian could not help but gave in, “Commander, nothing really escapes you!”</p><p>“Feng
Xiao is a man who knows how let go as much as he knows how to pick them back up,
he is someone who holds big ambitions, compared fighting with the Zuoyue
Bureau, to him, solving the case and finding the jade is his top priority.”
Then he stopped here, Cui Buqu felt something was a little suspicious, “Those
noodles just now, why does it feel like it’s similar to the ones I ate in the
Zuoyue Bureau?”</p><p>Qiao
Xian smiled, “In that case, is it delicious or not delicious?”</p><p>Outsiders
have always thought that she was cold and difficult to approach, they would not
have the opportunity to see her smile gently like this.</p><p> Cui Buqu, “Of course it is delicious. The Yangchun
noodles from the Zuoyue Bureau are the only noodles I am used to eating.”</p><p>Zhangsun,
“Qiao Xian made it.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu showed a look of surprise, “Since when did you learn how to cook?”</p><p>Qiao
Xiao, “Before I set out, I learned it from the chef. I’m afraid you are not
used to eating outside, who knew you also…”</p><p>When
she thought of what Cui Buqu went through the last few days, she really wanted
to kill Feng Xiao.</p><p>“I
am the one who willingly allowed myself to be caught, staying by his side,
these are naturally expected.” Cui Buqu replied plainly.</p><p>He
seldom told others what his intentions were, but since Qiao Xian is completely
loyal to him, towards her, he was more willing to say more.</p><p>In
the middle of their conversation, Pei Jingzhe was invited inside by the servants.</p><p>When
he saw how Qiao Xian glared at him coldly, he felt a little undeserving.</p><p>“Good
day, Lord Cui.” Pei Jingzhe greeted him politely. He already knew Cui Buqu’s
identity from Feng Xiao, then thinking back about how they treated him these
few days, he could not help feeling guilty.</p><p>“Where
are the presents?” Cui Buqu extended a hand towards him.</p><p>“What?”
Pei Jingzhe was taken aback.</p><p>Cui
Buqu answered lazily, “Since you came to here ask for my help, how could you
come here empty handed? Is this the ways of your House of Blades?”</p><p><i>How did you know I came to ask for your help?</i> When those words reached his mouth, he swallowed
them back down and smiled, “As you said, our Lord knew you were unwell, and
after going through such hardship, you definitely needed to rest, so I came
here today to pay you a visit. As for the gift, I have already passed it to the
servants of your house.”</p><p>When
Qiao Xian and Zhangsun came to the City of Six Crafts, they bought a little
manor and employed two to three servants that were deaf or mute. Compared to
the Zixia Taoist Temple and the Five Tastes restaurant, this was more peaceful
and quiet, and could be used as a place for resting.</p><p>However,
after Cui Buqu’s real identity as the Commander of the Zuoyue Bureau was
exposed by Feng Xiao, with his intellect, he could surely guess the location of
this manor, he even found out that the “Five Tastes” restaurant is one of the
Zuoyue Bureau strongholds.</p><p>“I
am tired, send him away.” Cui Buqu did not care about his nonsense and
proceeded to lie down, turning his back away.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe wanted to step forward, but Zhangsun Bodhi had already took a step
forward and barred his path.</p><p>“I
do have something to ask of you.” Pei Jingzhe thickened his skin and said
honestly.</p><p>Qiao
Xian glared at him coldly, “Is it you who asked for help, or was it Feng Xiao?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “Is there a difference?”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “The difference is huge.”</p><p>According
to what she said, it meant that Pei Jingzhe was nothing to them, if Feng Xiao
hadn’t made him come, then he would have already been chased out by them.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt cornered all of a sudden, like he was a sheep that walked into a
wolf’s pack, unable to fight back. Now he understood why before he came here,
Feng Xiao told him to be completely honest, no need to hide anything, because he
knew that Pei Jingzhe was never a match for the Zuoyue Bureau.</p><p>When
he thought until this point, he was a little bit unhappy, but he couldn’t help
saying, “In all honesty, I came here by orders of my Lord.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not even turn around to look at him, his back still facing him as he
laid on his bed.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe could only continue, “My Lord wishes for Lord Cui to interfere in the
matter of the Lu manor, to search for Qin Miaoyu’s accomplice.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “So, where are the presents?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was taken aback, now realizing what the other meant by presents.</p><p>If
he wants to ask for help, it is expected to offer something back in return.</p><p>“My
Lord says he is willing to split the contribution this time. After this matter
is done, he will send an edict to prove that the Zuoyue Bureau has contributed
in kind.”</p><p>Of
course Feng Xiao would not have put it so politely—he could imagine at this
moment, the Commander Feng Er would have placed a foot on the table, saying in
a non-committal way: <i>Do I look like I
would be cheated so easily? Give him half the contribution now, I will
definitely take it back in near future, just go, if his appetite is like a lion
and bargained endlessly, I will reclaim twice the amount back soon.</i></p><p>Listening
to how this sounded like a stage play, Pei Jingzhe could only rephrase his
words.</p><p>Cui
Buqu snorted, “He could not have said it that way, he would only say: ‘See what
that Cui Buqu wants only he would be willing to help, if he is absolutely
greedy, I will return the favour in the future.’”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe’s lips twitched as he heard, in his heart he could not help but added, <i>You both really know each other well.</i></p><p> Cui Buqu, “I can help, but I have one
requirement. I want Fo Er’s head on a spike.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “This……”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “If you refuse, then we can forget about working together, you can leave
now.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe immediately said, “Lord Cui please be patient, I will agree to this on
behalf of my Lord!”</p><p>The
Lu family’s case is indeed urgent, one might not say that Lu Ti has already
written a letter to get help. Surrounding the Lu manor is only a temporary
solution, but to avoid more problems piling up, it was still better to solve it
as quickly as possible.</p><p>“If
you agreed to it earlier, I wouldn’t have needed to lie down right after I’ve
just eaten and feel stuffy.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe twitched his lips, “It’s all my fault!”</p><p>He
brought Cui Buqu and the rest to the Lu manor, on the way Pei Jingzhe could not
help noticing Qiao Xian, yet she only glared at him coldly, so he turned his
head back.</p><p>“Lord
Cui, how should I address this lady?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu half-heartedly laughed, “Are you interested, or is Feng Xiao interested?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “How is this different?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “If you are interested, you go ask her yourself, if Feng Xiao is
interested……”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe waited for him to finish his sentence, but he immediately took a sharp
turn.</p><p>“Then
I would definitely not tell you.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>He
finally noticed that no one in the Zuoyue Bureau treated him like a friend.</p><p>But
of course, who asked his Lord to be so cruel, using the Naihe drug on someone
on their first meeting. Pei Jingzhe originally thought that the Zuoyue Bureau
and House of Blades would not have considered each other outsiders, but now,
this is even more difficult than he thought.</p><p>A
miserable grey cloud hung over the Lu family.</p><p>Lu
Ti’s treasured daughter is dead, originally he was already upset, and now his
manor is surrounded heavily by outsiders, this is just spreading salt over his
wound.</p><p>Men
under Feng Xiao did not suffice, so he took a few men from County Magistrate
Zhao, pretending not to acknowledge that County Magistrate Zhao was quite
unwilling, because he was not willing to offend Lu Ti, but he was also unable
to defy Feng Xiao’s orders. He was trapped in a predicament. So he could only
give the case to Magistrate Liu Lin, but told him to be a bit more merciful if
he could.</p><p>In
order to hold a burial for Lady Lu, they needed to purchase a few items. Liu
Lin brought men to the Lu manor, but by orders of County Magistrate Zhao, he
allowed the Lu family to leave through the back door and pretended not to see.
Who knew that Cui Buqu, Pei Jingzhe and company met them on the road.</p><p>“Stand
there! Who let you out!” Pei Jingzhe was both surprised and furious, stepped
forward to hold them down.</p><p>The
housekeeper of the Lu family suppressed his fury and begged, “Our Lady passed
away, we need to hold a funeral, we cannot just leave her like that, please
show us some mercy!”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “Whatever you want, we can let Liu Lin send a few men to purchase it
for you, but people from the Lu family are not allowed to leave!”</p><p>The
housekeeper finally could not stand it and shouted, “You people are really
bold! Our Lady hasn’t even got married and she’s met with such an incident. Our
mistress wants to hold a more rowdy funeral for her, to avoid her feeling
lonely on the road, she wants the best of everything, if we ask outsiders to
buy for us, how would they put it to heart? Are you people so mad that you
would not even spare a dead person?!”</p><p>“The
ones who wouldn’t let go of the dead are you yourselves.” Cui Buqu glared at
them coldly, pointing at the person standing behind the housekeeper, a female
servant with her head low. “He is a man in the disguise of a woman, take him.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was taken aback, yet Qiao Xian and Zhangsun Bodhi acted without
thinking twice, as Cui Buqu’s words dissipate in the air, they were already on
their feet, holding down the tall female servant.</p><p>The
female servant couldn’t help but raised her head. Pei Jingzhe found that she
looked familiar, and immediately recognized her on the spot. This is the cousin
brother of Lady Lu, that man who almost married into the Lu family, Su Xing.</p><p>But
bringing the topic back, Su Xing himself looked quite outstanding, this time he
hid behind the housekeeper and among a few tall servants. From afar, he did not
look obvious at all, if they hadn’t met each other on the road and was exposed
by Cui Buqu, he really could have just slipped out like that.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “Su Xing?”</p><p>Su
Xing was exposed, yet he did not panic. He said slowly, “She is my cousin
sister. Whatever she liked, hated, even Uncle and Aunt might not know. I
followed the housekeeper out, so I could buy her things she liked, so that she
would not feel lonely down there, can I not do this?”</p><p>His
eyes were swollen and puffy, and his face looked skinny, short hairs of beard
sprouting under his chin, as if he had just been through a round of pain.
Whoever saw this face could not call him cold-blooded, instead they would have
said that they were ill-fated, separated by life and death.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “Why did you masqueraded as a woman?”</p><p>Su
Xing, “My cousin sister and I were betrothed once, since she hasn’t married
yet, if I used the name of the Lu family to buy her funeral things, would that
not sully her name? My cousin sister is clean, and she should leave cleanly as
well.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu looked at him silently for a while and told the housekeeper, “The matter
will come to a conclusion today, after that I will return your freedom. I
consider myself and the Lu manor to have met by fate, so please let me offer my
prayers to Lady Lu.”</p><p>The
housekeeper knew Cui Buqu, since Zixia Taoist Temple, his medical abilities
were widespread and heralded in the city, the housekeeper’s mother was one of
the people who was treated by him.</p><p>He
sighed and extended a hand towards the back, “This way.”</p><p>The
hall held three generations of the Lu family. Lu Ti still had a mother that was
alive, in the year before the last, a coffin was already made for her to allow
her to rest here, but who knew that his mother was ultimately not the one to
use it, instead, it was his daughter.</p><p>The
coffin is there, but there was no cenotaph or candles and paper money. This is
why the Lu housekeeper wanted to go out to purchase them.</p><p>Once
Liu Lin saw Pei Jingzhe and the others came in, the colour of his face drained,
afraid that Pei Jingzhe would inquire about the people who went out.</p><p>But
Pei Jingzhe did not pay him any attention and allowed the housekeeper to take
them to the hall before inviting Lu Ti to come over.</p><p>The
coffin was already shut, and the hall that was used to welcome visitors had now
turned into a funeral hall. The pot used to burn paper money was already
prepared, yet there was nothing inside. Madam Lu wore green all over, looking
devastated as she sat in the hall, looking at the coffin with a lost
expression. Two female servants were at her side, yet she did not talk to him.
The Lu manor was completely silent and forlorn.</p><p>Cui
Buqu stepped over the threshold and took the joysticks from the female servant
and bowed towards the coffin, before approaching the incense to place the
joysticks there, then he came before Madam Lu.</p><p>“Be
at peace.”</p><p>Madam
Lu had been upset for many days, her face was worn, she could not even care for
her usual attire.</p><p>She
did not respond much even after hearing those words, so the old lady at her
side could only respond in her stead, “Many thanks, Master Taoist Cui.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I wish to examine the body.”</p><p>Once
he said those words, all eyes within the manor fell upon him and gasped.</p><p>Not
only did the Lu family’s servants gasped, even Madam Lu who was lost in her
thoughts raised her head to look at him.</p><p>The
housekeeper shouted in anger, “Did you not came here just to give your
prayers?!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I came to give my prayers, but also to investigate, I suspect the death
of Lady Lu is not a suicide.”</p><p>The
housekeeper, “Master Taoist Cui, you have done a favour for our Madam, but you
cannot do whatever you want and become a dog of the House of Blades!”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe said in his heart silently, <i>The
House of Blades certainly could not afford this man.</i></p><p>Cui
Buqu had just woke up, he wasn’t fully recovered yet, so he felt tired. Without
waiting for the housekeeper to offer him a seat, he went to find somewhere to
sit down.</p><p>“Stop
talking nonsense, when I say open, do I need to open the coffin myself?” He
told Pei Jingzhe impatiently.</p><p>“Step
over my corpse first before you open the coffin!”</p><p>As
Lu Ti rushed here, he heard Cui Buqu’s last sentence and became furious, he
wanted nothing more than to beat up Cui Buqu in that moment.</p><p>As
Qiao Xian saw this, so she immediately moved forward to push Lu Ti. White robes
fluttered in the air, seemingly light and weightless, yet somehow managed to
push Lu Ti five to six steps back, the latter needing to hold on to the wall
before he could hold his own ground.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not pay them any attention, but said three words. </p><p>“Open
up the coffin!”</p><p>Before
Pei Jingzhe came, Feng Xiao had ordered him to fully obey all Cui Buqu’s
orders. No matter what he asked for, as long as Cui Buqu agreed to help, Pei
Jingzhe follow his orders completely.</p><p>Right
now, since the other party spoke, although it sounded very ominous, the House
of Blades already had a strained relationship with the Lu family, so they could
not care less to offend them one more time. At that moment, he did not
hesitate, walking to the coffin, he mustered his strength and pushed the cover
right off.</p><p>

As Lady Lu’s parents watch the scene unfold,
they could not help but cried out. &nbsp;
