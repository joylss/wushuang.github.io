</p><h2>Chapter 24 – In This Episode, Peacock Feng And Little Cui Did Not Show Up</h2><br><br>
<p>A
manor such as this that hid in the city out of plain sight, no one would have
noticed it.</p><p>Its
doors were shut most of the year, only occasionally would a half-deaf old
couple leave the manor to purchase some vegetables and meat. Only when the
neighbours asked, did they find out that person living in the manor was
diagnosed with heavy diseases, so they could not leave the manor. Under the
sympathy of others, and the fear of whether such an illness was contagious,
after some time no one dared to ask more. Whoever lived within the manor
finally attained some peace with no one to disturb them.</p><p>Now,
it’s already late in the night, everywhere was silent. Every household had put
out their candles and slept, so the manor that sandwiched between them had been
even quieter. Qiao Xian and Zhangsun Bodhi hid near the corner and exchanged
glances. </p><p>Zhangsun
asked silently, <i>You are sure this is the
place?</i></p><p>Qiao
Xian did not want to converse with him impatiently. She immediately leaped onto
the roof.</p><p>Zhangsun
shook his head from the back, but followed her closely.</p><p>The
two of them fell on top of the roof silently. Bending her waist, Qiao Xiao
almost lifted a tile, but her hand was pressed down by Zhangsun.</p><p>The
latter pointed upwards at the moon, and Qiao Xian quickly stopped her
movements.</p><p>The
moon and stars shone brightly tonight. If the house was not lit and was
shrouded in darkness. The light above would have given them away. Perhaps
normal people might not notice it, but a skilled martial artist would
definitely be alerted.</p><p>Although
Qiao Xiao do not feel that there was anyone in the manor, she was still
cautious. Better be safe than sorry.</p><p>Qiao
Xiao descended to take a look and discovered that one of the windows had a hole
in it. There was a pillar next to it, so it could conceal both her and Zhangsun’s
shadows, allowing them to peek inside the manor.</p><p>Is
there anyone?</p><p>Qiao
Xian hid under the tree and gestured to him.</p><p>Zhangsun
slightly observed the place and gave her a surprising answer: There is.</p><p>Qiao
Xian grew stern.</p><p>Separated
by only a wall, if the one in the manor could cause them to be unable to sense
the presence inside, then it could only mean that they’re quite skilled.</p><p>This
would not be easy.</p><p>Could
it be that they knew they were coming, so they’ve prepared this early?</p><p>At
this moment, a clanging sound sounded from behind the manor.</p><p>It
was incredibly faint, but it could not escape Qiao Xian and Zhangsun’s ears.</p><p>And
of course, it wouldn’t escape the one inside the manor either.</p><p>“You
all came, so why act so secretive?”</p><p>The
woman in the manor snorted lightly, although it did not veil her lowkey anger, her
tone was charming and petite. It made one want to see her face.</p><p>Qiao
Xian and Zhangsun exchanged glances and flew towards the dark, wanting to watch
the third person reveal themselves.</p><p>“Come
out!” The woman in the manor could not hear a respond and shouted again, her
voice cold and sharp like arrows.</p><p>Behind
the manor there was a soft clang. A black shadow emerged and broke open the
window and came in, and started a battle with the woman in the manor.</p><p>Qiao
Xiao’s ears were alert, listening to it closely. It happened a little distance
away, and she could only hear that the woman in the manor used something akin
to a whip as her weapon. The other person used a sword, it rang and made
sounds, carrying an intention to kill. Every move it made wanted to aim for the
woman’s fatal spots. Although the woman couldn’t take advantage of it for now,
she managed to escape all those attacks.</p><p>But
these sort of scenes tend not to last long, if not mistaken, when the woman finally
seem to have ran out of patience, and her strength was wounded, it would be the
appropriate moment to take her life.</p><p>Of
course, Qiao Xian and Zhangsun could not let that Lady Miao die. They still
needed to question her about the case, so both of them rushed into the manor
without hesitation.</p><p>The
woman was battling a masked man. Qiao Xian then discovered that she wasn’t using
any whip, but her own sash. It was unknown what the white sash was made of, it
was soft yet tough that even a sword could not slice it in half. That masked
man used an assassination technique—every move he made himself wide open and
only cared to take the other’s life. If not for the weapon in her hand, the
woman would have already fell to his sword.</p><p><br>
When Qiao Xian and Zhangsun rushed in, the woman’s expression changed as though
two more enemies had appeared. Distracted, the masked man aimed his sword
towards the spot between her brows. Naturally, Qiao Xian and Zhangsun would not
allow it to happen. Zhangsun shot a Buddist bead towards the masked man’s
temple and Qiao Xian drew her sword to slash it upon his wrist.</p><p>Who
knew that the other did not even cared for his own life and continued to move
forward, determined to kill Lady Miao.</p><p>When
the sword almost landed, Lady Miao bended backwards with her toes tip-toed into
an impossible position, avoiding the blade that would have otherwise claimed
her life. The masked man’s sword went right pass her.</p><p>As
to what the sword caught, strands fell to the ground. Lady Miao only felt her
scalp stinging in pain and reached out to touch it to stop it from being
exposed.</p><p>Because
the sword just now had sliced off a part of her hair that even her scalp bled.
If just now she had depended on the two new comers on helping her, and did not
try to save herself, her corpse would have been on the ground by now.</p><p>The
masked man showed a look of anger through his eyes, seeing that he failed and
so many others present was hindering him, every move of his became even fiercer
and deadlier. Zhangsun shot one bead out after the next, aiming towards the
other’s sword. The enemy couldn’t help but had to move backwards, unable to get
close to Lady Miao.</p><p>Qiao
Xian was afraid that Lady Miao would use the opportunity to escape, so she left
Zhangsun with the masked man and went after Lady Miao, intending on capturing
her.</p><p>At
that moment, Lady Miao parted her lips to speak, her tone was stern.</p><p>But
Qiao Xiao could not understand it, and refused to slow down either.</p><p>Lady
Miao gave a strange look, then switched to the Chinese, “Who are you people!”</p><p>Qiao
Xiao, “People that could help you out of this, if you do not want to die, then
follow us back.”</p><p>Lady
Miao snorted, “There are a lot of people who wanted me dead, but I still lived
until now.”</p><p>As
they spoke, Zhangsun did not want to fight the other anymore, so he quickly
took out a short pestle, with a flicker of his wrist, it grew from an inch to
something as long as two foot and strike it against the masked man’s chest. The
masked man blocked it with his sword without any hesitation, but Zhangsun has
infused all his inner strength into the strike. Not only the sword failed to
block it, but it snapped in half, and the masked man’s body was even injured by
it.</p><p>Originally,
Zhangsun Bodhi wanted take hold of a survivor, so they can find out who in the
world wanted to take Lady Miao’s life, but the masked man, seeing that his
mission had failed, immediately bit the poison pill in his mouth and died on
the spot.</p><p>Qiao
Xian spoke to Lady Miao, “You have seen how powerful this man is. The Yunhai
Thirteen Stories owns not only one skilled martial artist such as his. If he is
gone, there would be someone else to replace him, but we can guarantee your
safety.”</p><p>The
beautiful eyes of Lady Miao flashed, “Who are you people? Why should I believe
you?”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “Because of this.”</p><p>She
took out a token from her sleeve. When Lady Miao looked closely, four words
were written on it: Kaihuang Zuoyue.</p><p>The
token looked like gold yet it wasn’t gold. One look and one could tell it’s
something of importance.</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “We are subjects of Zuoyue Alliance under the Sui Empire’s Emperor, our
positions are equivalent that of the six ministries. It doesn’t matter what
dangers you’re in, if you joined the Zuoyue Alliance, then you can be safe.”</p><p>Lady
Miao asked suspiciously, “I only knew that the Emperor sent the House of Blades
to investigate. I have never heard of the Zuoyue Alliance.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “The House of Blades was established by the Emperor. The Zuoyue Alliance
was established by the Empress. At the present, both Emperor and Empress stand
shoulder to shoulder in court. This, I am certain you have heard of?”</p><p>Seeing
that Qiao Xian was patiently trying to convince her, she knew that the other is
not someone who came here for the kill, so she relaxed, twirling her hair with
her finger and said in a relaxed manner, “But the ones I have offended are not
your match.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “The Zuoyue Alliance’s Commander is akin to the Minister of Justice. As
of now he is within the City of Six Crafts. If you agree to cooperate with us
and find the Jade of Heaven’s Lake, even if you killed the Khotan ambassador,
our Commander can guarantee your life will not be at risk and sent you away.
From what I can see, it would be better if you choose to trust us, compared to
being hunted after.”</p><p>Lady
Miao could only blink. Although the bleeding on her scalp stopped, the wound
still looked serious. It’s only because she was indeed extremely beautiful that
it would allow one to overlook the awkward wound.</p><p>“So
in that case, you have already know my relationship with Yuchi?”</p><p>Yuchi?
Yuchi Jinwu? The Khotan ambassador who died?</p><p>Qiao
Xian and Zhangsun exchanged glances and both of them suddenly managed to
connect everything, but their faces did not betray their thoughts?</p><p>“That
is correct. We are aware of it.”</p><p>Lady
Miao, “Fine, then. I shall tell you. The one who murdered the Khotan ambassador
and the one who stole the jade are the same people. Right now, he is within the
city.”</p><p>Qiao
Xian, “What is his name, and where is he now?”</p><p>Lady
Miao, “He is—“ </p><p>

But before she could finish, she immediately
disappeared!
