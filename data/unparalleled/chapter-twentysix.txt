<h2>Chapter 26 – Call Me ‘Dad’ Three Times, Then I Will Pull You Up</h2><br><br>

<p>Feng
Xiao of course would not write a reply. Although Pei Jingzhe was incapable, but
he was still a member of the House of Blades. He would not allow an outsider to
punish him. So, Feng Xiao ordered a few spies to watch over the surroundings of
the Lu manor, not allowing any of the people inside to leave, while he brought
Cui Buqu and headed towards the outskirts of the Huling forest.</p><p>Cui
Buqu was curious, “If you wanted to save Pei Jingzhe, why bring me along?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “With a hostage in their hand, they’re fearless, in such a situation, I
might perish in battle or lost idea of what to do. With a crafty man like you,
you might be able to yield a few strategies.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu stared at him. No matter how he looked, Feng Xiao did not looked as if he
would ‘perish’.</p><p>Of
course, the other’s next sentence was, “Just in case we encountered any
dangers, with you here, I feel a little safer.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu replied coldly, “I bet you want to use me as a meatshield.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Smart.”</p><p>His
footsteps were like wind, his <b>qinggong</b>
were already smooth like flowing water and cloud. To avoid Cui Buqu slowing him
down, Feng Xiao grabbed his waist and heaved him into the air as well. &nbsp;</p><p>Cui
Buqu only felt both his feet were floating above the air, not requiring him to
even use any strength, and suddenly he had already arrived at the destination.</p><p>The
moon shone through grey clouds, bringing light to the mortal world. Under the
moonlight, the Huling forest looked like it was practically glowing, yielding a
sort of calmness and peace that did not exist during the morning.</p><p>But
this peace was only an illusion. Perhaps Cui Buqu could not sense it, but Feng
Xiao can already sense the usual stirring in the air.</p><p>He
stopped on his footsteps.</p><p>“Since
you invited me, why are you hiding yourselves?”</p><p>From
the grassy lawn before, it looked peaceful and wild with sand everywhere, but
Cui Buqu did not even hear anything, yet looking up, a man was already standing
under a tree not far off.</p><p>It
was that Goguryeon man, Gao Ning.</p><p>Although
Gao Ning used the surname of the country, Gao, and was also one of the top
fighters in the Central Plains, his attired looked worn and old, almost like a
beggar.</p><p>He
wore grey all over, and looked more like a servant, but he cared less about it.
He kept his eyes on Feng Xiao the moment he showed himself and did not even
spare a glance at Cui Buqu.</p><p>This is, of course, not because
Feng Xiao was handsome, it is because he has decided that Feng Xiao is his one
true nemesis and wanted to defeat him.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “What about the man you
caught?”</p><p>Gao Ning was straightforward about
it, “None.”</p><p>His Chinese was not fluent, his
words were stoic and unfamiliar, even colder than the icy breeze that bellowed.</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled, “I knew that Pei
Jingzhe would have been so stupid, allowing you to take his token and still
couldn’t escape. Speak, who are your accomplices? The high and mighty number
one fighter of Goguryeo, using these underhanded methods. It seems that the
Goguryeons are merely just chicken and dogs, cowards and ghosts!” </p><p>Gao Ning’s face showed a hint of
anger, his hands rested on his sword, but beside him, someone else spoke.</p><p>“The provoking technique, there’s
no need to pay him attention.”</p><p>Another man appeared behind a large
boulder and Gao Ning calmed himself down, unmoving, that even Feng Xiao could
not sense where he was.</p><p>There was little room to guess who
could it be, when a high level martial artists that could rival even Feng Xiao
and coincidentally appeared in the City of Six Crafts.</p><p>“Is this not the number one fighter
of Turk? Did you drop something? Want me to find it for you?” Feng Xiao mocked
him.</p><p>Fo Er, “Tonight, you weren’t taking
it seriously when you fought me. I want another battle with you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “This is my first time
seeing someone who lost speaking so high and mightily. You people are not from
the Central Plains, so I wager you would not happen to know how to write the
words dirty, underhanded, shameless, and calculative?”</p><p>His voice was bland, but he had
said everything in one go, obviously carrying a mocking tone.</p><p>From the way Gao Ning and Fo Er
looked at them, they might just barely understood what he meant.</p><p>Feng Xiao was secretly glad, “QuQu,
I have never seen you being this adorable and loveable.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Lord Feng, please
refrain from being so self-centered. Resume addressing me as Master Taoist Cui,
don’t call me anything that makes my heart feel disgusted.”</p><p>“Men of the Central Plain, Hmph!” Gao
Ning laughed coldly, interrupting their conversation, “They only know how to
battle with words!” </p><p>After he spoke, he drew his sword
and flew towards Feng Xiao.</p><p>The glare of the sword was
blinding, almost like the arrays of a rainbow, a few times the speed compared
to how he held Pei Jingzhe hostage just now.</p><p>At the same time, Fo Er attacked
from the other side. With one on Feng Xiao’s left and one on his right, it
seemed they intended to go for the kill on the spot.</p><p>But Feng Xiao showed no fear. He
did not move until both of them were within reach, only did he push himself off
the ground with his foot and rose into the air, avoiding both of their combined
moves.</p><p>The zither rolled out from his hand
and he fell to the ground, the wind cooperated with the zither and sent
attacked towards the other two. However, Gao Ning and Fo Er was also able to
avoid it with ease.</p><p>Although Cui Buqu was not on good
terms with Feng Xiao, from that moment onwards, they were on the same boat. If
Feng Xiao was defeated, he would not be in a good place either.</p><p>Fo Er and Gao Ning joined hands
were indeed powerful, but Feng Xiao is definitely not a push over either.
Between the three of them it was impossible to tell who would win. Even if Feng
Xiao grabbed all the opportunities given to him, he might not even be able to
defeat them.</p><p>After Cui Buqu observed for a
moment, he relaxed and begun walking to a nearby boulder to sit on it before
continuing to observe slowly.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt
his hairs standing in cold swear, as if someone was blowing mouthfuls of air at
the back of his neck.</p><p>In reality there was no one blowing
air at the back of his neck, it was only the natural instincts of humans that
responded to danger. Cui Buqu did not know anything about physical combat, but
perhaps he was often sick, his body had accepted various kinds of medicine, his
five senses became more alerted and sensitive, at that moment, he did not even
hesitate and bend forwards to sprawl on the ground.</p><p>The moment he sprawled onto the
ground, a few things wheezes past his head, and in the next moment, Cui Buqu
discovered that not far in front of him, there were a few long needles sticking
out from the ground.</p><p>Needless to say, the needles were
stained with poison.</p><p>Cui Buqu only felt that his movement
was too sudden, so his back ached and his knees hurt. He did not have enough
strength to stand up again, and the threat that would claim his life is already
just right behind him. He could only roll to the side to save himself.</p><p>Once he rolled to the side, two men
in black stood, one front, one back, and rushed at him. Swords shone in their
hands, and while he could escape the attack before, but he definitely could not
escape this one.</p><p>There good comes from standing
close with the oleander! </p><p>Cui Buqu considered everything, but
he could not guess that, in the end, he wasn’t murdered by his own enemies, nor
did he died of illness, instead, his death would be because of Feng Xiao. He
did not have the time to open his mouth to shout bad words, but he was already
doing it in his heart, he cursed Feng Xiao’s ancestors all the way the
beginning of his heritage.</p><p>Then he closed his eyes, as if he
was accepting fate.</p><p>He did not know whether it was
because he had scolded in his heart, suddenly those sword fell to the ground,
and the pain that he anticipated never happened. Quietness fills his ears, Cui
Buqu opened his eyes and saw that Feng Xiao had managed to arrive on time,
holding down both assassins who wanted to kill him.</p><p>In this moment, the number of
enemies had multiplied by two. It became a one against four battle.</p><p>Feng Xiao did not even have the
strength to retaliate to Cui Buqu, it could be seen that his strength is
depleting.</p><p>One he was out of danger, Cui Buqu
said, “These two men are from the Yunhai Thirteen Stories, they even have
poisoned needles!”</p><p>The Yunhai Thirteen Stories had
appeared once tonight, but they had left when the woman in yellow, Bing Xuan,
exposed them. No one knew that they would appear so soon here again and joined
arms with Fo Er and Gao Ning.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Why did I not know that
the Yunhai Thirteen Stories don’t only assassinate people now, but had also
expanded to robbery?”</p><p>Of course, those two men would not
respond to him, but infused all their strength and attention at attacking Feng
Xiao. They did not even look at Cui Buqu, seeming that their target since the
beginning had always been Feng Xiao.</p><p>It was late night, the winds and
sand storm are gradually getting bigger. As the few shadows fought each other,
they didn’t even realized that they have reached a cliff. Looking downwards,
even though it was not consider very deep, it was still dangerous, enough to
claim a man’s life if he fell down.</p><p>A mouthful of sand filled his mouth
and nose, Cui Buqu practically coughed it out, but he refrained himself from
doing so. He knew that between battles of highly skilled martial artists, even
one mistake was more permitted. If Feng Xiao lost because of a distraction,
then the fate that awaits him would definitely not be a good one.</p><p>As he moved slowly to a dark spot
in the corner where nobody would notice him, using the large stone to hide his
present, coupled with the sandy winds that bellowed in the air. Everyone was
intent on surrounding Feng Xiao, no one noticed that Cui Buqu was missing.</p><p>Ever since the two assassins from
Yunhai Thirteen Stories participated, the situation had took a turn for the
worse. With four exceptionally skilled fighters going full out at the same
time, even if Feng Xiao is number one beneath the sky, it was impossible for
him to escape completely unscathed. Other than that, two of these men were not
from the Central Plains, and the other two were assassins, they would
definitely not follow the regulations of martial artists within the Central
Plains. With more in numbers, and after a few more exchanges of fists, Feng
Xiao’s stomach and shoulders were finally wounded and his moves became slower.
Fo Er saw the chance and took it, slapping a palm to his chest to send him
rolling down the cliff. Gao Ning kicked his zither into the other direction.</p><p>Feng Xiao fell down the cliff and
was quickly lost in the darkness. The Yunhai Thirteen Stories were assassins
who would pursue until the end. They did not hesitate before jumping down the
cliff. In that moment, sandstorms flew all around, mixed with a little rain and
snow, even high levelled fighters would not have been able to stand it. Gao
Ning and Fo Er originally did not know each other, but because of Feng Xiao,
they had agreed to become temporary allies. Yet once the enemy is defeated,
they quickly held their guard towards each other, and seeing how terrible the
weather is, they were not as obsessed as the assassins had been, so both of
them left, one into the west, the other into the east, and disappeared into the
snow storm.</p><p>Cui Buqu waited for a moment and
came out to investigate after he felt that those two were far enough.</p><p>His sights were not bad, but even
if so, it was difficult to see anything in the darkness such as this.</p><p>Even if Feng Xiao was unfortunate
enough to be alive when he fell down, he could not say what would happen if
those two assassins had found him.</p><p>Cui Buqu sighed in his heart. He
felt that it was a pity that someone with good looks like that would be gone
forever just like that, but at the same time he was glad that Feng Xiao was
gone. The House of Blades would be dull for a period of time, and that would be
the chance for the Zuoyue Bureau to rise.</p><p>As he though, a weak voice filled
his ears.</p><p>“Pull me up.”</p><p>Cui Buqu moved to the side of the
cliff and squatted, reaching out to touch over the edge.</p><p>As he touched here and there, he
really found a hand!</p><p>That hand quickly grabbed onto him,
practically pulling his entire person down with it. The latter quickly grabbed
onto the edge to prevent himself from being pulled down.</p><p>“Pull me, up!”</p><p>Feng Xiao’s voice was weak, it was
obvious that he did not want others to hear it, but it would also seem that he
was wounded quite badly.</p><p>“You are really lucky!” Cui Buqu
shouted back.</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled, “For someone with
the grace, looks, and elegance like myself, naturally, the heavens smiled upon
me. How could those little nobodies be able to wound me?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “But now you want me to
save you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “When we get back, I
will reinstall your freedom and let you go wherever you please.”</p><p>Cui Buqu said in his heart<i>. If I wanted to leave, you wouldn’t even be
able to lock me up.</i></p><p>“This is nothing. If you agree to
do something for me, then I will pull you up.”</p><p>Feng Xiao said impatiently, “I will
agree to anything, just pull be up first!”</p><p>He kept his voice low so the Yunhai
assassins would not be able to hear him.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Call me ‘Dad’ three
times, and I will pull you up.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “……”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Qinggong:</b></p><p> Qinggong is a technique in Chinese martial
arts. Traditional Baguazhang training involves the use of qinggong. The
practitioner runs up a plank supported against a wall. The gradient of the
plank is increased gradually over time as the training progresses. The use of
qinggong has been exaggerated in&nbsp;wuxia&nbsp;fiction, in which martial artists
have the ability to move swiftly and lightly at superhuman speed, and perform
gravity-defying moves such as gliding on water surfaces, scaling high walls and
mounting trees. (Wikipedia)
