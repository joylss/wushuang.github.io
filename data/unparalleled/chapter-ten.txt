<br><h2>Chapter 10 </h2><br><br>
<p>Although he had
managed to live through it with determination alone, the Naihe drug still did
damages to one’s body, especially when Cui Buqu’s body was never in prime
health in the first place, so this is equivalent to adding salt to wound. A day
later, when he woke up and touched his forehead, he knew that he caught a fever
again.</p><p>He breathed out
some warm air. Cui Buqu has long been used to such a feeling, but it did not
mean that he enjoyed it.</p><p>No one would be
willing to endure pain, but since there is no way of escaping it, he could only
chose to get used to it.</p><p>On the bed laid
a clean set of clothes and a thick robe. It must be items Pei Jingzhe ordered
someone else to take them here. It is impossible that Feng Xiao would bother
himself about such trivial matters, so Cui Buqu did not say anything but put
them on and wrapped himself up until he looked all serious and proper. In the
room, someone has also prepared a pail of water, so he used them to wash
himself before walking out of the room.</p><p>Feng Xiao
waited impatiently outside, making Pei Jingzhe come in to urge him to be
quicker.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe has
originally thought that Cui Buqu was always very slow, but when he saw the
other’s face was even paler than before, he coughed into his fists and felt a
little guilty, his voice was also low when he spoke/</p><p>“Master Cui,
are the clothes comfortable enough for you?”</p><p>“They are just
right, thank you.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
laughed coldly, “Today, we are not eating in the manor. My lord has said that
we can dine outside.”</p><p>Cui Buqu,
“That’s hard to come way. Just as I’ve woken up, there is a fresh meal waiting
for me.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
laughed awkwardly, “You just woke up yesterday. You cannot eat too much oily
foods.”</p><p>Cui Buqu looked
at him: This person’s face, it isn’t even half as thick as Feng Xiao’s.</p><p>He did not
move, not wanting to make it difficult for the other.</p><p>As soon as Feng
Xiao saw the other two merged, he could not help but snorted a little bit, “You
were even more delicate with wearing a clothes compared to a little maiden
riding her carriage!” </p><p>When normal
people are in a fever, their faces turn red, but Cui Buqu’s face radiated
paleness as he wore a white robe, making the colour of his entire person also
similar to the snow falling at his feet.</p><p>Cui Buqu said
blandly, “My host is abusing. I’m poisoned and left with no food, what can I
do?”</p><p>Feng Xiao look
as if he’s in a good mood and smiled, “Then you’re in luck today. There is a
tavern in the city that just opened, and they’ve employed the famed Lady Hong.
You’ve been here for six months, surely you wouldn’t have not known her name?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Lady
Hong from the Hong Baked Pastries Family?”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“That is correct.”</p><p>This Hong
Family that made baked pastries are famed in the city. It was run by the Hong
father and daughter. Both father and daughter were skilled the arts of culinary
and made delicious dishes. Their name travelled across the city. It’s said that
people who came here from Qiemo had to visit them at least once.</p><p>Cui Buqu also
visited them once. The taste wasn’t bad, and the soup was boiled from bones,
the noodles are as fine as silver strands. After the noodles was cooked in the
soup and taken out, mixed with some braised pork sauce and sprinkled with
spring onions. Eating one bowl of such delicacy can warm one’s stomach, and
make their entire body feel comfortable and relaxed, no different from the
biggest chefs in Beijing.</p><p>However, a
while ago, the father passed away, leaving his daughter alone in this world.
Everyone discussed about the remaining one and agreed that it was difficult to
manage the business alone. &nbsp;They were
also certain that Lady Hong would marry into a rich family and become a
concubine, then it would be even more difficult to taste her dishes anymore.</p><p>Yet contrary to
public opinions, Lady Hong refused that kind of luxurious life, instead, she
went ahead and accepted the job of a master chef.</p><p>Because of the
Linlang Alliance’s auction, martial artists carrying swords were seen
everywhere on the streets. Normal people could not escape being afraid, yet
Feng Xiao pretended as if he could not see them, taking both Pei Jingzhe and
Cui Buqu, he walked through the streets towards the restaurant.</p><p>Those who knew
martial arts often carried with themselves some amount of pride. These people
from <b>Jianghu</b> are no exception. They carry a sort of arrogance and walked
with their heads high. </p><p>Some people
formed groups of three and five even if they weren’t wearing the same uniform,
but the jade pendants on their swords are the same. Usually, this means they’re
from a famed sect: some are loners and travel solo, carrying either a cold or
threatening expression. Most of the time, the latter would not have a good
temper. There were also men and women who walked side by side, laughing as they
spoke. The woman was high-spirited and confident, her steps were fast and
light. These are most probably young juniors who just joined a sect.</p><p>Cui Buqu’s gaze
brush across them. With only one look, he would analyse where they came from,
vague who they were, and their current set of mind.</p><p>“Do not forget
what I brought you out for, Master Cui, it’s about time you show me what you’re
capable of.”</p><p>Cui Buqu rolled
his eyes after he heard what Feng Xiao had said, “I’ve yet to have breakfast,
I’ve no strength to speak.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
smiled lightly, “If you’re good and cooperate so I can solve the case earlier,
you can leave earlier as well. Is there any meaning in trying to spar words
with me now?”</p><p>Cui Buqu
laughed coldly, “Forgive me if I’m wrong, but yesterday you said if I am willing
to cooperate, you said you would <i>consider</i> neutralizing my poison, but
you will not definitely do it. Yesterday I was plagued by the poison, unable to
fight back. These sort of ambiguous promises – what are you trying to expect
from me?”</p><p>Feng Xiao took out
two bottles as thick as the width of two fingers from his robe and raise them
in front of him.</p><p>“I’ll give you
a chance. Among these two bottles, one if empty and one is the remedy that
could help you be at ease for three days. Whether you get it or not, depends on
your choice. Don’t say I wasn’t nice to you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu feels
like his heart is burning right now, as if someone lit fire to his chest, but
the fire hasn’t spread out yet. Even the bones felt their agony, like a
thousand invisible hands were holding onto his body. It is both itchy and
numbing, but he understood that this is the effects of the poison. Although
it’s not as painful as when the poison is reacting, it’s enough to make one sit
uncomfortably.</p><p>However, he
didn’t choose from those two bottles. Without even looking at them, he took a
detour and pressed his lips, walking ahead.</p><p>Feng Xiao
gasped, “How can you be so stubborn, there my kindness goes to waste!”</p><p>Cui Buqu smiled
coldly and did not respond.</p><p>The remedy is
only a temporary solution, it would not heal him completely. Was Feng Xiao
being kind? Not really. He simply wanted to wait until the poison took effect
before demanding him for answers again.</p><p>Seeing that the
other refused to take the bait, Feng Xiao puts the bottle back into his robes.</p><p>Not far off
from them there is really a new restaurant that opened. Above it, it wrote:
“Five Tastes”. Before it doors, many people were wandering about. It seemed
they were quite crowded. </p><p>Pei Jingzhe
booked a table earlier on. This way, once they arrive, they needn’t wait for
the others, they can just get a table for themselves as the waiter lead them
in.</p><p>From the
outside, it didn’t look much, but inside, there was a skylight. After Pei
Jingzhe walked behind their waiter for a while, he noticed that this restaurant
bought down the few stalls next to them and merge them all together. Creating
two sections: a big public hall and the VIP area. Once they entered the VIP
area, it was very quiet. &nbsp;Everywhere were
flowers and trees, and it was quite interesting.</p><p>“This tavern
hails from a rather impressive background. Who was it who invested in it? Was
it the Boling Cui Sect, or the Longxi Li Sect?” Pei Jingzhe asked in shock.</p><p>The City of Six
Craft had always been a small city from the beginning. It can never compare to
the grandness of the capital Beijing. If it hadn’t been for the Linlang
Alliance’s auction event, there wouldn’t have been so many merchants,
businessmen that came here to live for a few days and barter for resources
while purchasing some goods there. Opening such a big tavern here, Pei Jingzhe
thought, eighty prevent of its investment was a waste.</p><p>The waiter
smiled and told them, “Then you’ve guessed wrong. It’s not the Li Sect or the
Cui Sect. Our Young Master is local, and have been working for the greater half
of his life. You young Lords are very fortunate. I’ve heard that Lady Hong has
even invented a few new dishes!”</p><p>The three of
them were invited into the VIP area. There, one hall had four tables
altogether. On one table, there was a young man and woman with a few servants
standing behind them.</p><p>Although they
didn’t have a whole room to themselves, the four tables weren’t so packed. They
were far apart and did not stand in the way of the other.</p><p>Feng Xiao
orders the dishes and not long later, the dishes were served one by one.
Although the cooking crew isn’t just Lady Hong alone, but her style can be seen
on them.</p><p>“Silver strand
noodles with braised pork sauce, Cauliflower soup, Fresh Vegetable soup, Hong
Baked Patries, you can choose what you want to eat, don’t say that I was mean
to you. Now, I’m truly treating you well, right?” He used his chopsticks to
poke at the dishes, then three more bowls of lotus soup were served.</p><p>This is not the
season for lotuses to bear fruit, the City of Six Crafts was never a place to
produce lotus either. These lotus were brought from a thousand miles from the
south, dried and stored throughout winter. The price of these three bowls of
lotus soup could be said, was more expensive than all the other dishes added together.</p><p>For the sake of
the lotus soup, Cui Buqu finally opens his mouth. “That woman’s surname is Lu.
She’s from a very wealthy family, and it’s said that they are related to the
Fanyang Lu Sect. However, they haven’t been exchanging messages for a while
now. The father’s name is Lu Ti and is the owner of an antique shop. It’s said
their branches were open all over Jiangnan. He is one of the top wealthiest man
in the City of Six Crafts.”</p><p>His voice is
neither high loud or soft, only loud enough for Feng Xiao and Pei Jingzhe to
hear, but not enough for the couple to hear.</p><p>Feng Xiao is
very satisfied with his initiative to act without being told. It’s rare that
the two weren’t bickering and were speaking like calmly.</p><p>“And the man?
Is he also part of the Lu family?”</p><p>Cui Buqu shook
his head, “His surname is Su, named Xing. He is a cousin of the Lu family. A
few years ago, both his parents died and his home well. He came over here to
live under the roof of his cousin sister’s family. Lu Ti funded him to study and
it’s heard that he has the intention to make Su Xing his son-in-law, if nothing
goes wrong, they’re to be wedded within these two years. Lu Ti has no sons, so
the one who succeed his business would most likely be Su Xing.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “And
this restaurant? Is it opened by the Lu Ti?”</p><p>Cui Buqu said
blandly, “I am unsure about it. After all, I’ve been locked up for a few days,
I could have missed a lot during that time.”</p><p>He was using
the opportunity to roast the other, however the other did not respond to it.
Feng Xiao picked up a pastry, breaking a small piece from it to put it in his
mouth. He ate as he spoke, “This taste isn’t bad. The feel in my mouth is
great, usually, someone who had just recovered from their illness or had been
poisoned wouldn’t have the chance to taste such a delicious thing. Buqu,
wouldn’t you want to try?”</p><p>Cui Buqu: “……”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
almost let out a laugh, but quickly turned his head away.</p><p>Then he saw
that young man picked up &nbsp;a fried fuchok
with his chopsticks and put it into the woman’s mouth, “Miao Miao, is this not
your favourite dish? Come, eat more of it!”</p><p>“Thank you
cousin brother.” Her voice did not hide her glee.</p><p>The people of
this era are very open, especially those in the North. Unmarried men and woman,
if accompanied by family, and under the public eyes, would be mostly intimate.
Pei Jingzhe turns his gaze back and heard Feng Xiao speaking to Cui Buqu in a
high pitched voice.</p><p>“QuQu, is this
not your favourite dish? Come, eat more of it!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe has
some baked pastry in his mouth, but he almost spat it out.</p><p>However, the
true one suffering right now is Cui Buqu. The latter has just picked up some
vegetables froze on the spot, the corner of his lips twitching, a murderous
look on his pale and elegant face.</p><p>Upon hearing that
someone was copying his actions and words, the young man’s face turned
irritated.</p><p>“We do not know
each other. Sire, why are you deliberately provoking?”<br>
 <br>
　　</p><p><b>Jianghu</b>: I could just say ‘pugilist world’ and it means the same, but I feel
like Jianghu is a lot more appropriate. Jianghu is basically the world of
martial artists who live apart from normal humans. They dedicate themselves
either to a life of study of lore (medicine, worldly matters), quite similar to
philosophers, or they dedicate an entire life to investing in martial arts:
inventing new techniques, forms, sword styles, among other things. They have
their own Jianghu rules to abide, which is another topic entirely. The imperial
rules of the capital or whoever is reigning often so not apply to them. Jianghu
members have their own set of rules to follow.</p>
