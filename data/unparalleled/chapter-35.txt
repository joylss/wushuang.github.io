<h2>Chapter 35 – Feng Xiao’s Face Turned Green In Colour</h2>
<br><br>

<p>Of course, Su Xing would
not entertain Feng Xiao with his nonsense, and he did not have the mood to
fight with him and compare their abilities as martial artists. To him, the most
important thing now is to escape, everything else can be seconded.</p><p>He hid in the Lu family
for so many years, yet his skills were not dulled. Compared to that year when
he left Goguryeo, his skills were even better than before. When an animal is
cornered, he would only throw away everything and fight to the death, so Su
Xing is the animal, with every move he wanted to force Feng Xiao to take a step
back.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe tossed the
long sword in his hand towards Feng Xiao, to which the latter caught it in a
light and smooth motion and countered the sword that Su Xing sent flying
towards him. As the swords clashed, Su Xing felt a little shaken, his wrist
went numb, and the soft sword in his hand vibrated slightly and swayed.</p><p>As he saw that the
situation is not to his favour, he immediately turned to leap into the air, his
figure was like light feather floating into the air, and it was really a sight
to be seen. Even Qiao Xiao could not help but said suddenly, “His foundation in
qinggong is solid, unlike a Goguryeon!”</p><p>“How do Goguryeons
practice their qinggong?” Pei Jingzhe asked. </p><p>Qiao Xian’s face looked
like an iceberg, and she shut her mouth, refusing to say anything.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe twitched his
lips and felt a little guilty, in his heart, he said: <i>The one who poisoned your Commander is not me, the one who tied him up
and brought him everywhere is not me either. It’s all my Lord, I am only
listening to his orders, why do you keep targeting me?</i></p><p>Yet the one who responded
to him was Cui Buqu, “Goguryeons and Fusang people are close relatives, the way
of their martial arts are also similar. They emphasize on sneak attacking and
stealth, either lurk in the dark, or take their target’s life with a single
attack, or act quick and swift to overcome their enemies. Few of them would use
these sort of methods. Most of the time, only women would practice these type
of qinggong.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe looked taken
aback, “Could it be that Qin Miaoyu was the one who taught him? But he sold her
off!”</p><p>Qiao Xian lets out a cold
laugh.</p><p>Even though she didn’t
say anything, but Pei Jingzhe could feel what she wanted to express: That all
the men in the world are cold-hearted and that they forget sentiment easily.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe couldn’t help
saying, “They were both originally on the same boat. Qin Miaoyu deceived Su
Xing, took the jade for herself, now Su Xing betrayed her, isn’t this a dog eat
dog!?”</p><p>Qiao Xian said coldly,
“Qin Miaoyu is not a good woman. Towards Lady Lu, Su Xing could repay her with
such treatment, so what is selling off Qin Miaoyu mean to him?”</p><p>As Lady Lu was mentioned,
Pei Jingzhe turned towards the coffin and immediately shut his mouth.</p><p>After these few sentences
were spoken, Su Xing leaped into the air and left the Lu manor, far away from
reach.</p><p>He suddenly found it
strange that he did not feel a pursuit behind him, but as he thought about
that, someone flashed before his eyes, he felt his shoulder pricked with pain
and his entire person suddenly fell to the ground. Even if he was holding a
sword now, he might also not have won.</p><p>The moment he fell to the
ground, his <b>energy gates</b> were
suddenly sealed by someone. Su Xing watch Feng Xiao land in front of him and
blinked.</p><p>“If you want to kill,
then kill me! I only beg for a swift death!”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “My seal.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe knew what he
should do. He walked towards and took the seal from Su Xing’s pocket,
presenting it back to Feng Xiao.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Master Taoist
Cui’s words are equivalent to my own, I shall keep his word. If she could be
found in the places you’ve given, the House of Blades will keep its promise and
lighten your sentence.”</p><p>Su Xing looked up in
disbelief, as if he did not expect that Feng Xiao would keep to his promise. On
the other side, Lu Ti could care less that his neck was still bleeding, he
rushed over to send a fitting slap over Su Xing’s face. His face immediately
swung to the side, and one side of his face was swollen.</p><p>“Return my daughter back
to me!” Lu Ti grinded his teeth, his face twisted in fury, all he wanted was to
strangle the man to death, but he was pulled away by Pei Jingzhe, “You, don’t
stop me!”</p><p>“It’s best if you take
care of Lady Lu’s funeral. This man will be taken care of by the House of
Blades.” Pei Jingzhe said before aiming an elbow towards the back of Lu Ti’s
neck, putting him into a sleep and allowed the Lu servants to take him away.</p><p>This matter is over, but
the same could not be said for the case.</p><p>“I have assisted Lord
Feng to solve the Lu family’s case, and aided you in capturing Su Xing. May I
also know when is the Lord Feng going to fulfil his part of the deal, bring Fo
Er’s head before me?” Cui Buqu did not invest in beating around the bush and
went straight to the point.</p><p>Feng Xiao tapped forehead,
as if he had just thought of something, “Forget to tell you, when I was on my
way here, I saw Fo Er from a distance, he seemed like he was heading towards
your residence. If I did not remember wrongly, Khan Apa’s ambassador, is
currently living there?”</p><p>The colour on Qiao Xian’s
face changed, “Why didn’t you say so just now!”</p><p>Feng Xiao said
innocently, “You did not ask just now, and wasn’t I busy trying to pin down Su
Xing, for a moment it slipped past me, but if you head over now, you might
still make it!”</p><p>Cui Buqu gave Qiao Xian a
look, the latter acknowledged it immediately, without saying another word, she
turned and ran.</p><p>“Lord Feng, are you
really planning to go back on your promise?” Cui Buqu laughed.</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled happily,
“I said I would help you kill Fo Er, but I did not promise when. To kill him
now, or in future, is the same. The fault lies in you who did not make it
clear, if we added new requirements now, do we not need to discuss the deal
again?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Your
requirement.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The
discussing of terms with the Khan’s ambassador, I want half of it. Half the contribution
and half the honour.”</p><p>Cui Buqu said without
even thinking twice, “No way!”</p><p>“There’s no other way,
then.” Feng Xiao sighed regrettably, “You heard it. Cui Buqu is the man you
want, this time don’t go for the wrong person.”</p><p>Cui Buqu: ???</p><p>As Feng Xiao’s voice
dissipated, someone appeared on the roof.</p><p>The other leaped onto the
ground, a knife appearing as quickly as wind, and ran towards Cui Buqu!</p><p>Of the two people by his
side, Zhangsun Bodhi was already sent away by him, and Qian Xiao had ran after
Fo Er, at that time, there was no one to defend him.</p><p>He only heard Feng Xiao
cackling at the side, “This is Fo Er’s disciple, Song Ji. Although his abilities
are not extraordinary, it is all he needs to kill you.”</p><p>As he spoke, the knife
was a hair’s out of reach from its target. Pei Jingzhe’s expression changed. He
wasn’t as cold-blooded as Feng Xiao, but from his distance, it was impossible.
The only one who can rescue Cui Buqu was Feng Xiao.</p><p>At that moment, Cui Buqu
shouted loudly, “The discussion, you can have half!”</p><p>“Isn’t it better to agree
earlier?” Feng Xiao smiled, and moved along with his voice, appearing by Cui
Buqu in the blink of an eye.</p><p>His robes fluttered,
effortless as Song Ji felt a rush of energy towards him, and he couldn’t help
but fall backwards, hands pinned against his back by Pei Jingzhe. </p><p>This man was originally
the youngest disciple of Fo Er, he was latest to join his sect and his martial
arts was the lowest among everyone, yet Fo Er loved him the most. This time Fo
Er came to the Central Plains to kill Khan Apa’s ambassador, he brought his
littlest disciple along, wanted to allow him to be exposed to a new environment
and train his martial arts while in the Central Plains. At first, he only made
him stay at a distance away to spy on Khan Apa’s ambassador so he wouldn’t be
put in a dangerous position, but Song Ji was young and brimming with desire to
prove himself. Although his tutor ordered him to stay hidden, when he listened
to Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu’s conversation, he could not help but leaped out,
wanting to take Cui Buqu.</p><p>Who knew that Feng Xiao
keep switching sides. A moment ago he was still glaring at Cui Buqu, as if he
wanted him dead, in the next he was helping him. Song Ji grinded his teeth, he
lost a chance to take Cui Buqu, in fact he was taken himself.</p><p>In Feng Xiao’s eyes, Song
Ji was nothing to him, so he snickered and laughed mockingly, “<b>The gentleman’s word is as if as a whipped
horse</b>, QuQu, you are the great Zuoyue Bureau Commander, better not foil
this matter.”</p><p>That means, if you play
dirty, I can play dirty too, so we can both dig pits for each other, but neither
could take advantage of or use the other.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I am not a
gentleman, but I will honour my word, though one ought to help the other until
the end. Qiao Xian is not Fo Er’s match, you need to follow me back, kill Fo Er
for me.”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled
cheekily, “Just now I was just speaking nonsense. I have not seen Fo Er at all.
If you want to know where he is, no harm in asking his disciple, with this man
in hand, there’s no need to worry that the tutor himself wouldn’t show up.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, …...</p><p>Feng Xiao, “You’ve pitted
me a few times, so let us consider that we are even now. We ought to shake
hands and be allies instead.”</p><p>Cui Buqu said in his heart:
<i>Shake your goddamn hand. </i>However, on
the outside, he agreed and nodded his head, “Correct. We are even.”</p><p>Both of them shot each
other a glare, with smiled that looked like daggers and make one’s skin tingle.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe’s lips
twitched: <i>…..This really is enough!</i></p><p>Feng Xiao, “Right now, I
am going to search for the whereabouts of Qin Miaoyu, QuQu do you want to come
with me?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Tonight I will
be discussing with Khan Apa’s ambassador, if Lord Feng desires to be involved,
you may partake the discussion as well.”</p><p>Feng Xiao listened and
knew that Cui Buqu really decided to keep his word and work together, he felt a
little surprised, “I thought that you would recalculate the benefits before
agreeing to it.”</p><p>Cui Buqu gave a sharp
laugh, “Do I look like someone who procrastinates?”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled
submissively, “In that case, it is my fault for thinking poorly of you.”</p><p>The Lady of the Lu family’s
death being unravelled, too the Lu couple, is that their daughter was murdered
by a Goguryeon that masqueraded as a family members for years. They did not
feel better towards their daughter’s passing compared to when they assumed Lady
Lu had drowned herself. Madam Lu woke up from her unconsciousness, and when
everything came pouring back, she felt incredibly regrettable. However, Lady Lu
is already sleeping in the coffin, everything was too late.</p><p>In the other world, it
was unknown whether Lady Lu Si felt regret for choosing the wrong person.</p><p>The most painful things
in the world, is that time cannot turn back, broken mirrors cannot be fixed,
and water that has been poured out cannot be gathered back.</p><p>The Lu family were all in
a despairing situation. Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu have no business to remain there
for too long, so they went their separate paths after leaving the Lu manor.</p><p>Cui Buqu suddenly
remembered something and called Feng Xiao, “Ah, I just recalled something
related to you, but I am unsure whether I should tell you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao saw how badly
Cui Buqu was pretending to look troubled, he felt his instincts tingling like a
bad omen, “Then don’t say it.”</p><p>Cui Buqu said it anyways.
“Just now when I was inspecting the corpse, I put my fingers into Lu Si’s mouth
and touched the green bean cakes that she ate. After that I’ve forgotten to
wash my hands before taking the seal from Pei Jingzhe. I recall you are a
person of cleanliness? I am absolutely sorry.”</p><p>Feng Xiao: ……</p><p>Pei Jingzhe did not look ‘sorry’
like Cui Buqu, but he could see that Feng Xiao’s face had turned green in
colour.</p><p>Cui Buqu did not wait for
Feng Xiao to take his revenge, he vanquished shortly after he confessed at the
speed of light, as if he wasn’t ill or sickly the same way he was coughing just
that morning.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe stared at the
colour on Feng Xiao’s face, and said carefully, “My Lord, then should we,
search for Qin Miaoyu first, or…… return and take a shower?”</p><p>“Search. Qin Miaoyu.” Two
words seethed through Feng Xiao’s teeth.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe suspect that
Qin Miaoyu is going to be a very unlucky victim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Author’s Note:</b></p><p>A short scene unrelated
to the story.</p><p>Feng Xiao: We agreed not
to pit each other.</p><p>Cui Buqu: No problem.</p><p>As they both turn around
to walk, they fell into the pits dug by each other for themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Energy gates:</b> Operating on traditional Chinese concepts of Qigong, energy gates
are spots in the body where the Qi (energy) flows through. To seal them usually
prevents a person from using the energy (Qi) in their body to perform martial
arts until those energy gates were released. One can seal an energy gate by
tapping on the exact spots on the body.</p><p><b>The gentleman’s word is as if a whipped horse:</b> A Chinese proverb. It doesn’t make much sense
translated, but you just need to know that Feng Xiao is trying to tell Cui Buqu
to keep his word since he’s said it, even if the latter is reluctant.</p>
