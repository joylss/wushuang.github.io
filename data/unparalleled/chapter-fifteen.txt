<br><h2>Chapter 15 - Feng Xiao: I Played Myself </h2><br><br>

<p>Just as Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu were
in the Linlang Alliance’s hall waiting for the Jade of Heaven’s Lake to appear,
the Spring Moon received a very strange guest. </p><p>The reason as to why the guest is
strange is because he had shaved all his hair and he held prayer beads in his
hands. To say that he is a monk is not right, as he is wearing the usual
clothes, yet it is also not correct to not call him a monk, because his face
looked like a well that had dried up. He did not look like he was here to
entertain himself, instead, he looked like someone who came here to spread
Buddist teachings.</p><p>The mistress of the place Lady Xue
received a lot of guests in the past years, but this is the first time she had
seen someone so strange. She heard that the guest has disregard all propriety
and bust himself inside, so she could only simply grab a hair piece, yawned,
and walked down the stairs with a few guards by her side.</p><p>When both gazes meet, Lady Xue had
to suppress her anger for a little and switch to a smiling face. </p><p>“My Lord, in the Spring Moon we do
not receive guests during the day. If you want, you can come back after the
evening.”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi, “I heard there is a
Lady Yunyun whose dance has astounded half the city, I came here to see her.”</p><p>Lady Xue covered her lips and
laughed, “I fear that Lady Yunyun hasn’t even woke up yet at this hour!”</p><p>If regular customers of the Spring
Moon were here and witnessed how Lady Xue acted so aggressively towards a
customer that did not know the rules, their jaws would have fell out right
away. However, to Lady Xue, she has interacted with many different people in
the past, so Zhangsun Bodhi’s handsomeness was enough for her to relieve her
disgust, putting on a smile and welcoming façade.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi’s eyebrows furrowed,
“But I am only travelling pass the City of Six Crafts, tonight I would be
leaving. Can I really not see her once?”</p><p>He took out a pouch and gave it to
Lady Xue.</p><p>Once Lady Xue opened it, she was
stunned on the spot.</p><p>Inside the pouch there were
numerous large and round pearls from the Southern Sea, gleaming under the
sunlight.</p><p>With Zhangsun Bodhi’s handsome face
added with this bag of pearls, let alone asking Lady Yunyun to accompany him,
even if he had asked for Lady Xue herself, she would not have declined.</p><p>“My lord, please come this way. I
will call for Yunyun at once!”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi nodded his head
slightly, his gaze mildly moving to the house in front. With a light movement
and a shadow, he very quickly disappeared from sight.</p><p>If they wanted to avoid
suspiciousness, of course, it is best if they came at night, but after much
discussion with Qiao Xian, they still decided that it was more convenient to
come in the morning. It would be easy to catch them off guard, and it might
even lure the culprit out.</p><p>The Spring Moon’s building is very
complex, consisting of many turns and allies, it was as if it has hidden many
mysteries inside. Zhangsun Bodhi walked behind Lady Xue, thinking that this is
indeed a place that is easy to hide a person, especially when the one is
skilled in martial arts. As long as one remained quiet, hiding behind flowers
and trees, no one could really have found them.</p><p>“This is Yunyun’s place. You may go
up yourself, but she might not have woken up.” Lady Xue laughed.</p><p>Although this Yunyun is someone who
sold both her skills and her body, but she isn’t someone just anyone could
have. It’s only because Zhangsun Bodhi was simply too generous, taking out a
bag of pearls like that. It’s not only enough for one Yunyun, even if he wanted
ten Yunyuns, it was enough.</p><p>After Lady Xue spoke, she turned
and left. Zhangsun knocked on the door twice, and the door opened quickly
afterwards. A young woman starting at him standing outside.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi, “I am here for
Yunyun.”</p><p>The young woman got angered, “You
don’t really know the rules, don’t you? The lady don’t accept guests in the
day. Leave quickly, or I’ll call the guards.”</p><p>Zhangsun, “It is Lady Xue who
allowed me to come.”</p><p>The young woman was stunned for a
moment, her anger turning to sorrow, but after a moment, she peacefully said, “My
lord, this way. Please take a sit, Yunyun has yet to woke up, but I will call
for her now.”</p><p>Zhangsun nodded, “Thank you.”</p><p>The place was really meticulously
decorated. Around Zhangsun’s surroundings, he could see there was a pot of
lamei flowers in front of the window. He was thinking of how they were able to
get blossoms during spring, so he got up to take a look only to realize it was
actually silk flowers. Only because it was presented extremely well. It’s
colour is very evenly spread out, and it was deeply attractive, it can pull off
the look quite well.</p><p>“Do they look nice?” Behind him,
the voice of a woman sounded.</p><p>“They do.” Zhangsun Bodhi turned
around, “Did you make this yourself?”</p><p>Yunyun smiled but did not reply.
She was only wearing a thin outer robe that hug loosely on her body, looking
leisurely and relaxed.</p><p>“It’s good if it looks nice. Does
it matter where it came from? My lord, why did you come here so stubbornly in
the day, that even Lady Xue was unable to stop you?”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi said simply, “A bag
of pearls.”</p><p>Yunyun listened and understood
immediately, she laughed, “No wonder she was willing to make you an exception.”</p><p>After she spoke, she immediately
held Zhangsun’s hand and leaned close to him.</p><p>It does not matter that Lady Yunyun’s
dance is beautiful and alluring, that many wealth men willingly threw their
money to her. Beautiful women were easy to get anywhere, but everyone tend to
be in a hurry into the act. </p><p>Yunyun knew this, so she did not
imitate the other girls from other entertainment taverns.</p><p>However, Zhangsun Bodhi pushed her
hand away.</p><p>“I want to see you dance.”</p><p>Yunyun laughed, “My lord, are you
feeling shy, so you wanted to see a dance instead? It is possible, but there
are no instruments here, I can only let my maidservants play the lute.”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi, “I am not shy,
neither am I pretending to be a gentleman. I truly just want to see you dance.”</p><p>His expression was pale and neither
was he smiling, the way he spoke was almost convincing.</p><p>“Do you remember this golden
hairpiece?” Zhangsun Bodhi took out an ornament from his sleeves and gave it to
her.</p><p>At first Yunyun looked confused,
but later on colour returned to her face, as if she remembered something.</p><p>“Are you that… from the western
ally…”</p><p>Zhangsun nodded his head, “Eight
years ago, a young man wandered the streets nigh starvation, it practically
claimed his life. It is you who gave him a golden hairpiece and allowed him to pawn
it for money. Later that, he strived hard in life, with enough money, he bought
this hair piece back and carry it on him at all times, only to return it to
you. To draw an end to the kindness that you begun.” </p><p>Yunyun stared at the golden
hairpiece for a long money, tears slowly filling her eyes. In the end, they
fell onto Zhangsun Bodhi’s palms.</p><p>“Eight years. You are already a
man, and I have grew old.”</p><p>Zhangsun, “If you are willing, I
can redeem you from this place.”</p><p>Yunyun wiped her tears and shook
her head, “I enjoy days like this, to be able to perform before many eyes on
stage. You need not be worried for me. You can keep this hairpiece as a form of
memoir. What dance do you like to see? I’ll dance for you.”</p><p>After that brief conversation, Lady
Yunyun’s attitude towards Zhangsun Bodhi changed. She acted incredibly familiar
with him, no longer awkward and distant like she was before. </p><p>Zhangsun looked at her intently
before putting the golden hairpiece back into his sleeves.</p><p>“Then, please dance ‘Zui Dong Feng’.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>……</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Linlang Alliance’s
stall, practically no one managed to sit still. The quiet atmosphere was heated
up at once. A few people stretched their necks to look at the waitress’ hands
that was holding the jade, round and beautiful and perfect.</p><p>There was no need for the Linlang
staff to introduce the item. Whoever held knowledge of gemstones would know
that this is a valuable piece of treasure.</p><p>“The Jade of Heavne’s Lake looks
like that?” Pei Jingzhe could not stop himself but spoke. </p><p>They have tried to estimate the
facts before. It is very likely that the Jade of Heaven’s Lake would appear in
the Linlang Alliance’s auction event, but no one thought that he would come in
such a glorified manner. If the House of Blades came out now and took the jade
away, wouldn’t the other party’s schemes fall apart right then and there?</p><p>“Could this is a fake?” Pei Jingzhe
thought of this possibility.</p><p>Since the Linlang Alliance took out
it out, it would be too late for them to keep it. Regardless whether it’s the
real one or a fake one, they can only determine it if they own it.</p><p>“This item’s origins is unknown.
The Linlang Alliance would not bestow upon a conclusion. So, the starting price
of the item will be set to five guan, whoever wants to bid for a higher price,
please help yourselves.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s voice rang
throughout the halls. Someone shouted six guans, and the prices kept building.
No long later, it became fifty guans, and the crowd was still in the heat of
the moment. The prices kept rising, until it was impossible to see that it
would end any time soon. Even Lin Wei who had been silence also joined the bid
and straightaway shouted a whole one-hundred guans before someone pushed the
price higher.</p><p>“My lord, what should we—“ Pei
Jingzhe could not help but asked Feng Xiao.</p><p>With a jade like that, even if it
is not the Jade of Heaven’s Lake, it would still draw a commendable attention
from the crowd. Adding to the fact that news of the Jade of Heaven’s Lake being
lost was spread throughout the place. Many people who kept close to winds knew
of it. It is because of this reason that this jade now looked familiar to more
people compared to the few items before it.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Wait a little more.”</p><p>That waiting lasted until the price
finally reached three thousand and two hundred silver taels. Seeing that the
bidders has begun to slow down now, under Feng Xiao’s orders, Pei Jingzhe
shouted five thousand silver taels, added with the price of ten pearls from the
Southern sea.</p><p>The place immediately quietened
down.</p><p>Everyone stared in Pei Jingzhe’s
direction.</p><p>Cui Buqu pulled the brim of his
robe loose around his neck, moving away slightly sideways avoiding the gazes of
everyone. </p><p>Feng Xiao purposely moved closer to
him, “You’re no little lady, why be so shy? Are you not willing to see this?”</p><p>Cui Buqu answered coldly, “For you
to grab attention like that, I fear that if I am seen with you. Even if someone
murdered me in my sleep tonight I wouldn’t even know what happened.”</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, extending a hand
to put it on his waist and said in a suggestive voice, “Then you can share a
bed with me. I guarantee you will sleep soundly until the next sunrise!”</p><p>Cui Buqu rose to his feet. Raising
a hand, at the blinding speed of thunder, he slapped Feng Xiao across the face.
It all happened in the blink of an eye that even Feng Xiao himself who was
unparalleled in martial arts could not respond to it. He wobbled a little
before finally taking a step back.</p><p>“You shameless, despicable, unscrupulous
lecher! After taking my sister, you would not even let me run free? I even left
for the City of Six Crafts, yet you refuse to cease pursuit. Has this world
became lawless?!”</p><p>Under the eyes of everyone, Cui
Buqu looked terrified, the fact that his face is pale made him look even more
convincing. It made them think of a bamboo in the midst of snow, brittle yet
refusing to break.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “……”</p><p>Never in his life would he thought
that Cui Buqu kept holding in and refusing to speak, only to wait until he was
under the eyes of public. The way everyone looked at Feng Xiao changed
immediately.</p><p>Feng Xiao thought to himself, this
time, he really did played himself.</p>
