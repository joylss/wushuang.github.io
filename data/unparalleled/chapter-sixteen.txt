</p><h2>Chapter 16 – Fool, That Was Just Mulberry Juice</h2><br><br>

<p>After
Cui Buqu stopped talking, he covered his mouth and started coughing.</p><p>His
coughs followed one after the last, and sounded more and more serious, causing
him to bend down slightly. His whole body shook when he coughed, like a bamboo
in the midst of a huge wind. </p><p>During
these two months, the Zixia Taoist Temple’s name rose within the City of Six
Crafts. Not everyone present here are locals, but there are still a few who
knew Cui Buqu, so they shouted loudly, “Master Taoist Cui, are you alright? Do
you need any help?”</p><p>“In
broad daylight, I can’t believe there are still people who would do these kinds
of disgusting things. Master Cui, please come down here, let us call the
bureau!” Someone else shouted.</p><p>Cui
Buqu coughed a few more times and laughed bitterly, “This is Feng Xiao from the
House of Blades. He came here to investigate the case of the Khotan
ambassador’s murder. He insisted that I had something to do with the case, so
he held me under custody. Even if you went to the magistrate, it would be
pointless. I appreciate your kindness. Just now, I just… could not hold it in
anymore!”</p><p>He
coughed quite violently just now, so his eyes were brimmed with tears, yet no
one was concerned for him. Everyone only saw that Cui Buqu’s face was pale and
weak, the tears made him look very pitiful.</p><p>Even
Lin Wei who held romantic feeling towards Feng Xiao could not help but grew
suspicious: Could it be that Feng Xiao was only gentlemanly on the surface, but
in reality his hobbies were eccentric and beyond horrifying. Not only he slept
with both men and women, but he also prowled but the sickly and ill types?</p><p>If
he thought about it in this manner, then as to why Feng Xiao was not interested
in him… it all made sense.</p><p>Lin
Wei was beginning to wonder about the last time he tried to act in front of him
to get his attention, yet he didn’t know Feng Xiao’s background or origin, it
made him stunned for a moment. The Lin family was very close with the people in
the palace. Lin Wei’s network was also often quicker than others. He knew what
to imagine when he heard the words ‘The House of Blades’. He himself did not
know who Feng Xiao was at first, and he even dared to have sexual thoughts
about him? Now that he thought about it, he felt that he had went a little out
of his place.</p><p>The
Linlang Alliance’s auction was cut off in the middle. The middle-aged man
panicked a little and did not know how to respond until Feng Xiao laughed
loudly.</p><p>“I
said it myself, I insisted that I would want both. Your sister is fragile and
beautiful, and you are intelligent. So what if I owned both of you? With the
power the House of Blades hold in front of the Emperor, these sort of trivial
matters do not suffice to flaunt the imperial laws! A-Cui, I’ve trained your
sister, and now, all’s left is you. If you are willing to follow me, I
guarantee that from now on, regardless of what you want, I can give it to you!”</p><p>He
flashed an evil laugh at Cui Buqu as if Cui Buqu really had such a sister and
had married into Feng Xiao’s house. </p><p><i>You have a plan, but so do I. Is this not just
throwing stones at each other, who is afraid of who? </i>Cui Buqu laughed coldly, “But are these habits of
a gentleman? I have told my sister before, that when she is with you, you seem
to have some sort of weird hobby. Yet she refused to listen to me and loved to
take off everything to let you spank her. She also said she loved it when it
hurt, the more painful the better. You tortured her until she is half dead. I
wager these are things you are too cowardly to let others know!”</p><p>The
entire hall gasped. </p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>He
is completely immune to it, his entire face was expressionless as he watched
these two ruin each other’s reputation, stomping the other’s name down into the
mud.</p><p>Lin
Wei opened his mouth widely, shocked beyond words.</p><p> In his heart, he spoke: Who knew Feng Xiao
looked all proper and gentlemanly, yet he hide such a hobby. On the other hand,
while he himself was a cut-sleeve, and was considered unusual, at least he is
still normal on other aspects…….</p><p>The
corner of Feng Xiao’s lips twitched.</p><p>He
thought that he was cruel enough to himself, and that he was also quick to
think of a backup. Who knew that someone else was even quicker than he had
been. That Cui Buqu was even crueller than him.</p><p>Both
of then glared at each other, big eyes glaring at smaller eyes. After a while,
Feng Xiao decided to let the matter go and deal with the serious one at hand.</p><p>He
flipped his sleeves and spoke to the middle-aged man, “This is my personal
matters. There is no need for everyone to be so concerned. If you hold any
curiousity, you may come forth to the House of Blades. Today the auction has
yet to come to an end, we cannot dally here, can we?”</p><p>The
middle-aged man looked as if he woke up from a dream, “Y-yes! No one has
claimed this piece of jade yet. Everyone, please take your seats!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu sat back down again and looked completely calm. Now, even though he is in
the hands of Feng Xiao, and it had all begin with an accident, it had also been
a part of his plan. Since he is now playing his own game, of course he could
not leave the place. At the very least, he could disgust Feng Xiao a little
bit.</p><p>From
the uproar just now, everyone seems to find it difficult to sit in peace. No
one else bid for the jade, so it was ultimately owned by Feng Xiao. After that,
there were a few more treasures and naturally it resumed to being fought for by
everyone. Feng Xiao did not participate again and only waited for the auction
to come to an end. He took Pei Jingzhe and Cui Buqu and left the place, turning
to the Qiushan manor.</p><p>“Master
Cui, your mouth is so powerful. With just two or three sentences, you ruined
our lord’s name!” Pei Jingzhe exclaimed as he thought about the incident just
now and felt a little frustrated. His tongue was not as sharp as Feng Xiao, at
that time, he could not think of anything more to refute. If he has attacked
Cui Buqu just now, it would just prove Cui Buqu right.</p><p>“I
still have the Naihe drug in my system. Saying two sentences like that cannot
make up to that. Just now, I did not vomit blood in front of the audiences, that
is already being kind to you two.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu looked pale, no longer having the terrified shade of colour he had put on
just now. He sat there peacefully, calm like mountains and seas.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt unhappy, “Then vomit a mouthful of blood for me to see!”</p><p>Before
he even finished talking, Cui Buqu opened his mouth and cough. A mouthful of blood
colour liquid fell onto his robes, creating a red stain.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “?!!”</p><p>He
was in for a shock. Immediately he leaped three foot into the sky, almost
running forwards to check on Cui Buqu.</p><p>Feng
Xiao’s light voice travelled to his ear, “Fool, that is just mulberry juice.”</p><p>He
locked his eyes and glared. That red colour did not look dark red like human
blood, but a shade of red that looked purplish.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>Cui
Buqu raised his sleeve to wipe juice off the corner of his lips, showing no
guilt at being called out.</p><p>“I
choked.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe’s mouth twitched and he recalled. A while ago in the Linlang auction event,
the waitress did bring them a few drinks. Cui Buqu did order a cup of mulberry
juice, but for him to keep the juice in his mouth until now to spit it out, he
thought it was not an easy thing to accomplish.</p><p>Feng
Xiao smiled, “QuQu, you look even more pleasing to the eye now. Would you
really not consider coming to the House of Blades? The position of the Fourth
Commandant of the House of Blades awaits you. With a gentleman’s word, the best
horses of the lands would not be able to give chase.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Are you considered a gentleman?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Fine, I am not a gentleman, I am a vile man. A word from a vile man,
could at least worth the speed of two horses? Or should I just say, that your
place in the Zuoyue Alliance is even higher than I had imagined?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I have said it before, I have never heard of the Zuoyue Alliance.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Then let us talk about the jade.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe place the jade on the table.</p><p>Under
the sunlight, the jade reflected rainbows. They practically saw their own
reflections on the jade.</p><p>“Of
the men who participated in the bidding just now, including me, there were six
people. Do you know who they are?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu responded, “Lin Wei from the Yandang Estate. Zhou Pei, one of the top
wealthiest businessmen of Khotan. Boling Cui Sect’s Cui Hao. A Goguryeoian man,
Gao Ning. Anlu Zhang Sect’s Zhang Yingshui.</p><p>It
was as though he had long expected Feng Xiao to ask such a question and
answered everyone’s name without even stopping to think.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Among them, who do you think is the most suspicious?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe originally thought that Cui Buqu would not know how to answer, perhaps
something like, “How would I know”, but this time he was incredibly cooperating.</p><p>“Zhou
Pei. His father is a Turk. According to rumours, he is a cousin to the Khan Ishbara’s
number one martial artist, Fo Shou. And that, Goguryeoian man, Gao Ning.”</p>
