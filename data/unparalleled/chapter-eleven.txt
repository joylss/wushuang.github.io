<br><h2>Chapter 11 – Relax, I Am Even More Vengeful Than You Are </h2><br><br>
<p>“You are such a strange man. This
isn’t your home, and you are not involved in the conversation. Is there no law
if I cannot even speak in a public place like this?”</p><p>Feng Xiao did not even turn his
head to glance at the man. He insisted on placing the piece of meat in his
chopsticks on Cui Buqu’s bowl. Cui Buqu extended his hands to pull his bowl
away, but as if those chopsticks has eyes, it naturally followed the same
direction and still placed the meat into the bowl. </p><p>Cui Buqu glared at the piece of
meat in the bowl, as if he was looking for any traces of Feng Xiao’s saliva on
the meat, looking as if he did not even feel like touching the bowl now. </p><p>But that was far from the end. Feng
Xiao picked up a plate of green beans from the table towards him.</p><p>“You disliked the taste of chives,
no matter, there are still cooked beans. Come, I’ll remove the skin for you.
They are white and tender. Quick, take a bit, or would you prefer if I fed you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>His hands looked attractive,
therefore, he looked like he was picking flowers when he peeled the beans. In
the blink of an eye, a much of cleanly peeled beans appeared in front of Cui
Buqu’s plate, lined up cleaned in rows.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Eat.”</p><p>Cui Buqu knew that there was motive
behind his actions, but he still twitched the corner of his lips, turning his head
to look outside the window, only to see that there was no one. </p><p>The one who got annoyed was someone
else.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Su Xing’s face became incredibly
red. He wanted to stand up and argue with him, but he was stopped by the woman
next to him.</p><p>“Cousin brother, let it slide!” The
young woman’s voice was soft and low. Her expression looked embarrassed. “I
know that Master Cui, the one next to him is surely his friend.”</p><p>“It is him who provoked me first. I
have to give him a piece of my mind!”</p><p>Su Xing’s face was full of
irritation. He turned to Feng Xiao and huffed, “Such a shame you look like a
gentleman, yet you act like a simpleton who don’t think before you talk.
Utterly disgraceful!”</p><p>The young woman walked towards Cui
Buqu and courtesies, “Good to see you, Master Cui.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, of course, recognized
her, “<b>May you be at blessed</b>, Young
Mistress Lu, how is your mother faring?”</p><p>The young woman gave him a smile, “It
was thanks to your formula, my mother has healed much from her illness.”</p><p>Cui Buqu nodded, “My method can
only ease her condition a little bit, but it is not suffice to heal her
completely. The Lu family still needs to look for better physicians for her.”</p><p>The young woman gave a nod of
acknowledgement.</p><p>At that moment, Su Xing also said, “So
the one who helped healed aunt is this Master Cui. My aunt’s health has truly
improved these days, please have my gratitude.”</p><p>He turned towards Cui Buqu and
courtesies before changing his topic and added, “Forgive me, but this friend of
you is really unreasonable and unmannerly. Master Cui, you have a good
reputation, you should not acquaint yourself with such a man.”</p><p>Cui Buqu replied flatly, “You have
misunderstood. He is not my friend, and I do not know him either.”</p><p>Su Xing stared at Feng Xiao in a
questionable look, his face obviously showing that he did not believe a single
word.</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, “What are you looking
at me for? Although my looks are unparalleled and the aptness of my skills are
rarely found among others, that is not something you can level with.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>The colour of Su Xing’s face
switched from blue to white, then white to blue again, as if what he was
poisoned from what he had just ate a while ago.</p><p>With Cui Buqu and Lady Lu here, Su
Xing could not fight Feng Xiao even if he wanted to, so he simply walked away.</p><p>Feng Xiao watched both of them leave,
a flippant look on his face, divulging a shadow a deep though.</p><p>“There is something wrong with this
Su Xing, so you purposely did that to introduce them to me?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Lu Ti has no sons. After
Su Xing fled to his house, Lu Ti treated him as though he was his own son.
Although Su Xing enjoyed studying, his talents are only average. Instead, he
followed Lu Ti out on job trips and showed some talent there instead. This made
Lu Ti very happy, at this present moment, two shops are now under Su Xing’s
supervision.”</p><p>“That is indeed very suspicious.”
Feng Xiao said, “As a business man who converses with many different sort of
people, he should be charismatic and smooth, yet why did he got provoked so
easily just because I was mimicking him?”</p><p>Cui Buqu laughed coldly, “Perhaps
it is because Lord Feng, your face is one that everyone wishes to beat up when
they see you. No matter where you tread, everyone is annoyed.”</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, “How can that
be? Just now you should look at the way Lady Lu looked at me. She was obviously
envious.”</p><p>Cui Buqu has met many narcissistic
people before, but for one to be so narcissistic to <i>this</i> sort of level was his very first experience. Taking a look
back, &nbsp;he also saw that Feng Xiao’s
expression had the vague look of disbelief.</p><p>“Lord Feng, are you often so
self-contained, praising yourself so in your own lonely shadow?”</p><p><i>Not ‘often’.
Merely, he has always been like this.</i> Pei Jingzhe answered in his heart.</p><p>Feng Xiao wriggled his eyebrows, “Is
that not the truth?”</p><p>Cui Buqu snorted. He was too lazy
to continue bantering with him, so he continued the topic a while ago, “The
only possibility is that he acts differently towards the Lu family.”</p><p>“The Lu family loved this specific
temper, so he acts accordingly in front of them. Lu Ti liked people who are
intelligent, so when Lu Ti is close, Su Xing appears to be an intelligent,
crafty young man that is eager to learn. How interesting is this!”</p><p>Feng Xiao then changed his topic
suddenly, “QuQu, you were only in the City of Six Crafts for two months, yet
you have done the background search of practically everyone here. You did not
spare even the female members of the Lu family. Ah, to think those who knew
only your identity of a Taoist surely would think you are plotting something
shady!”</p><p>Cui Buqu coughed twice and faked a
laugh, “Even if that is the case, haven I not fallen into the hands of you, the
Second Commandant of the House of Blade’s evil hands?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Of course not. The
House of Blades acts under the orders of the Emperor. Are not you criticizing
our present Emperor with your words? I am a very vengeful person.”</p><p><i>Relax,
I am even more vengeful than you are.</i> Cui Buqu answered in his heart and
coughed again, intending to spare his strength.</p><p>After they had their lunch, the
three of them went to the Lanling Alliance’s shop.</p><p>What Feng Xiao and Pei Jingzhe didn’t
know was, after they left, two people—a man and a woman—stepped into the VIP
area.</p><p>“Just now I saw that the Commander
did not look too well. I don’t even know if he fell ill again!”</p><p>The woman who spoke had voice like
clear ice, yet she was utterly beautiful. Both features of hers blended well on
her body. </p><p>The man did not spoke. He simply
walked towards the table that Cui Buqu and the rest sat a moment ago and lowered
his head to take a look, suddenly spreading the beans apart. </p><p>“What did the Commander left
behind?” The woman also approached.</p><p>“Plum Blossom.” The man answered.</p><p>The woman looked questioningly.</p><p>“The Commander wants us to
investigate plum blossoms?”</p><p>The man’s words are brief and curt,
“Khotan murder case.”</p><p>He loved words like gold, and spoke
as less as he could. Thankfully, the woman had worked with him for many years,
so she understood his words and picked up several hints.</p><p>“These plum blossoms are related to
the Khotan murder case, but if it was easy to investigate, then the House of
Blades would have already investigated. The Commander would not have left it
behind for us. Regardless, we should go to the perfume stall to inquire.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>May you be blessed</b></p><p>:
This is not a very accurate translation from the original text. I’m not quite
sure how to translate it, but you only need to know it’s a greeting Cui Buqu
used that was originally from the Taoist Pantheon. It sort of just means ‘May
you be blessed with endless luck and goodness that even you wouldn’t have
imagined yourself.’
