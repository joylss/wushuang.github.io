<br><h2>Chapter 2  - Cui Buqu</h2><br><br>
<p>It goes without
a doubt that it’s extremely complicated to investigate what happened throughout
an entire night in a weather like this.</p><p>This place was
not far off from City of the <b>Six Crafts,</b> so news of the Khotan
ambassador’s murder—were it to travel to the ears of those inside a city—would
no doubt raise some panic. </p><p>Coincidentally,
the emperor sent men from the capital to receive the Khotan ambassador, but,
who knew, no one managed to receive him. Instead, they came into contact with
such a murder case.</p><p>The county
magistrate of the Six Crafts was timid. All they want was for their work to be
delivered as promised. Yet, what surprised him was that this important guest
from the capital wasn’t easy to get along with at all. So, he had said nothing
but accepted the case and brought people out to investigate.</p><p>Magistrate Liu
Lin raised his head, watching as the wind gradually dies down, the snow coming
to a halt. He exuded a breath.</p><p>As the
magistrate of the City of the Six Crafts, it would be difficult for him to
avoid taking responsibility if the imperial court wanted to investigate the
death of the Khotan ambassador outside their city. As he thought and thought,
he had no idea which thief would’ve been so bold as to murder the ambassador of
another country. But, so to speak, he’s never heard of any bold thieves in the
City if the Six Crafts. Those who only sought for a fight would not have dared
to attempt such a big scene.....</p><p>He thought
nonsense as he flipped the corpse around to look.</p><p>The guards were
all busy sweeping away the snow that gathered, revealing seven to eight corpses
that were buried underneath the snow. Most of them looked like the previous
corpse, having their throat punctured that claimed their life.</p><p>Only the man in
the lavished horse carriage alone had a hole punctured in his chest rather than
his throat. </p><p>Liu Lin simply
bent down to pull out a saber from the snow and suddenly exclaimed: “A <b><i>yatagan</i></b>!”</p><p>“There’s a <i>yatagan
</i>here too!” another guard shouted.</p><p>Blood was still
on the saber. This is a weapon that has killed many people.</p><p>Could it be the
Turks who did it?! Liu Lin felt shocked.</p><p>The more he
thought about it, the more likely he feels it was a possible theory.<br>
Everyone knew that if the Turks and the Sui Dynasty engaged in a war,
those who were at the side lines would dare not sleep in peace either. For a
long time, the Turks were unhappy at the fact that Khotan decided to flee under
the banners of the Sui Dynasty, so it was possible that they used the chance
now to murder the ambassador in order to cause a dispute between Khotan and the
Sui Dynasty, turning them into enemy countries.</p><p>Many people
came to the same conclusion as Liu Lin.</p><p>Until this
moment, the case is nigh a final conclusion, ready to be wrapped up and
determine the cause and reason of the ambassador’s murder, but Liu Lin could
not brace himself for the next headache that’s to come: If the Turks appeared
near the City of the Six Crafts, it was possible that they might have also
entered in the city by now. The Linlang guild recently established a trade in
the city. Men across the lands—the wealthy, pugilists—all would gather here.
Yet at this moment, they have to deal with a murder case.</p><p>He could already
foresee the fate that awaited him. If he did not handle his duties well and
allowed the Turks to infiltrate the city, he would be doomed.</p><p>As he humoured
the idea of losing his job soon, Liu Lin could see a foreboding black cloud
before his eyes, feeling his hands and legs weaken.</p><p>Among the
important guest’s subordinates, there was a young man by the surname of Pei. As
he got out of the carriage, he was holding a small cabinet.</p><p>The model of
that cabinet was one that was growing popular in the capital as of late. It was
small and had three layers. If the third three layer was removed, eight columns
could be seen. It was convenient to put things such as cosmetics and little
tidbits inside. Placing it in the carriage was indeed convenient and loved by
women. Some wealthy women would even place jewlery and expensive treasuries in
them. </p><p>Pei Jingzhe
held the chest in his hands. Even though it was not as lavished as the ones
they saw in the capital, it was still made of good wood and excellent
craftsmanship. Looking closer, one could even see an engraving of a woman
dressed in Khotan traditional clothes doing a dance.</p><p>The third
drawer was then pulled out.</p><p>In the first
drawer, dried peach and apricot were placed in it. On the second, some jewels
and hair ornaments. When the third drawer was opened, they discovered some
veneer used by women. There were patterns of fishes, insects, stars and moons,
cut out using a golden foil.</p><p>It would seem
like there were women among this company, Liu Lin thought.</p><p>This is also
not unusual. According to the rumours, the ambassador of the Khotan Kingdom is
a relative of its king. It was perfectly common for them to bring a concubine
or two when they travelled out of the kingdom. However, it was regretful that
before they could even witness the grandiose of Xingcheng, they had already
lost their lives.</p><p>“Look around
for female corpses.” At the same time, the man also spoke.</p><p>As he laid the
orders, everyone listened to him immediately, dismounting their horses to
embark on the search.</p><p>The expensive
coat that previously belonged to the man, at this moment, was discarded on the
ground amidst the snow. Liu Lin watched in heartache, muttering to himself,
before gathering his attention and joined the search.</p><p>Among this
company, except for the mounted bodyguards, there were four carriages
altogether. One carriage was shared among the Khotan ambassadors. One was used
to carry provinces. One was used to carry tributes meant for the Sui King. The
last one, a smaller carriage, must have been for the female servants of the
ambassadors. So they discovered two female corpses buried deep in the snow near
that carriage, the very same deep gash across their throats that claimed their
lives. </p><p>The two maids
were quite beautiful. Liu Lin thought that they might both have been the
ambassador’s bed warmers as well as his servants.</p><p>But the man
kneels over, his nose almost touching one of the deceased female maids, almost
as if he was going to kiss her. Watching such a handsome face near the face of
a deceased that had splotches of green and black, Liu Lin could not help but
shiver.</p><p>But the man
didn’t seem to care much and remained that way. He looked closely at the
corpse, sniffing all the way down and even reached out to undo the corpse’s
collar with his hand. He looked exactly like a perverted man! The young man who
originally looked very calm also would not bear the sight before him and
shouted loudly, “My Lord!”</p><p>“What are you
shouting for?” the man replied and walked over to the other corpse and knelt
again, sniffing for a long moment before declaring, “There is another woman.
Search.”</p><p>Another woman?
Liu Lin was stunned.</p><p>The man
answered a little impatiently, “Inside the carriage, I smelled a fragrance that
I did not find on the body of these two women. They are not the same. So, there
is another woman around. Find her!”<br>
 <br>
Everyone moved quickly to search, but in the end, they’ve only
managed to uncover twenty-one corpses; other than the two female corpses, the
rest were males.</p><p>The man spoke
to Liu Lin, “Leave one team here to attend the crime scene. Bring the rest of
the bodies back.”</p><p>So, it is done
already?</p><p>The Khotan King
would definitely want to pursue the murder of his ambassador here. If the
bodies were removed and the snow started falling again, all evidence would be
wiped out. Then, how would they still investigate the case?</p><p>Liu Lin looked
absolutely confused. He wanted to ask but dared not to, so he could only looked
at Pei Jingzhe and gave him a few hints with a few glances. </p><p>Pei Jingzhe
sighed. He picked up the expensive coat that was discarded to the ground and
braced himself for a good scolding. “My Lord, are we really going to leave?
We’re not bothering with the carriages and the horses?”</p><p>The man asked
him back, “Tell me, by remaining here, what more can be done?”</p><p>Liu Lin
intercepted and spoke, “Shouldn’t we bring the carriages and the weapons back
to be solid evidence? In the future if people asked, at least we have something
to show them.”</p><p>The man
replied, “There is no need for the carriages, but the weapons can be brought
back together.”<br>
 　　 <br>
 He did not explain himself
much, got up on his horse, and turned around. His white robes fluttered in the
wind as he went. The remaining men looked at each other, unsure of what to do.</p><p>The guard
situated at small regions were not as trained and skilled as those in the
capitals. To compare them with men from the House of Blades, even lesser things
could be said. Pei Jingzhe could only remain behind and gave Liu Lin
instructions on how to clean up the crime scene. One team of men would sent the
bodies and weapons back to the city before returning to Qiushan Manor.</p><p>Qiushan Manor
was situated on the southwest of the City of the Six Crafts. It was surrounded
by mountains and bodies of water and offered a sense of quiet among disquiet.
The County Magistrate Zhao is very wealthy; thus, this manor had been his
wife’s wedding gift. Come every spring break, he would bring his family here to
live for a few days. This time, the ambassador from the capital had yet to
arrive, but he had already ordered servants to tidy up the manor. Once the
important guest arrived, they could directly bring him here. If the guest was
comfortable, he would also have less troubles to face.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
quite enjoyed the place here, especially when the snow hadn’t fully melted and breaches and new
leaves were already beginning to sprout. The manor here had an elegance he
could not find in the capital, so every time he visited, his mood would
automatically turn good.</p><p>But he knew
that the Second Commandant of the House of Blades’ mood would definitely not be
good for the next few days.</p><p>The copper bell
chimed as the man who moved ahead and went back first just now arrived. He
looked drawled and lazy, yet his fingers were deft and skilled as they rolled
up the letter before inserting it into the bamboo tube.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
could not help but lighten his steps, but the other man’s eyelashes quivered,
as if he already noticed his presence. </p><p>“Send out some
men to investigate the woman that ambassador brought with him.” Feng Xiao
passed the bamboo tube containing the letter to Pei Jingzhe and said.</p><p>The Qiemo
County is a place situated between the City of the Six Crafts and the Khotan
Kingdom. On the surface, it belonged to the Sui, but they have been occupied
with dealing with the Turks and the Southern Dynasty; they have not been able
to put much thought to this place.</p><p>From the
Central Plain to the Western Regions, Qiemo County was a place they have to
pass inevitably. After a long time, this became a place to restock supplies.
People from all across the lands would gather here to take a breather. The
House of Blades had long since placed as a stronghold here so they could send
letters containing information conveniently.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
took the bamboo tube and could not help but ask, “Do you have a lead on this
case at the moment?”</p><p>Feng Xiao took
a document and toss it towards him.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
caught it clumsily and opens it. The ambassador’s name was Yuchi Jinwu, the
nephew of the Khotan King. In the letter, the Khotan King expressed his
sincerity and admiration for the Sui Dynasty, hoping that they could form an
alliance and help each other defeat the Turks.</p><p>The truth is
finally out: The Khotan King had wanted the Sui to assist them in dealing with
the Turks, yet they were also afraid that the Sui would impose their rule upon
them. So on one side, the Khotan King strived to form a relationship with the
Sui; on the other hand, they were also being wary of the Sui.</p><p>The royal
decree was only meant for the King of Sui, but since the ambassador is dead
now, in order to solve the case, it had become one of the evidence, therefore,
it was entrusted in their care.</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu and
his company’s murder was for neither riches nor wealth. Even the royal decree
was still left in the carriage. Everything was perfectly complete.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
closest the royal scroll after he finished reading it and spoke to Feng Xiao:
“My Lord, a Khotanian was murdered within Sui lands. This would bring shame to
the Sui’s pride as well as create discourse between Khotan and the Sui Dynasty.
This does seem like something the Turks would do.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
twitched an eyebrow, “They came into our lands and murdered someone, why did
they have to use a yatagan? If they had simply used a sword made in the central
plains, then we would not have a lead to work on.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
touched his chin, “Turks have always been impulsive and violent. If they’re
committed murder under the daylight, it wouldn’t be strange. Other than that,
now the Turks and the Central Plains are crossing swords. So if they took our
weapons, we would’ve known?”</p><p>Feng Xiao: “Did
you not notice, in that carriage, someone else was missing?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
thought long and hard. The royal scroll that has been the most important
evidence was even there. What else can be missing? The tributes brought in by
the Khotan ambassador was there as well….</p><p>Suddenly, a
light of knowing flashed in his eyes, “The tribute list! We did not find any
list of the tributes that were being sent here.”</p><p>Feng Xiao lets
out an ‘Mn’, as if he felt that Pei Jingzhe wasn’t completely beyond hope.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe had
long since gotten used to the Second Commandant’s queer mannerisms, so he was
only surprised to receive approval from Feng Xiao. He added, “The murder took
away the tribute list, could it be that they took one of the tributes and did
not want us to know? But we only need to ask the Khotan King, and all will be
clear.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “To
travel there and back here, the time wasted is sufficient to do a lot of
things. Bring that cabinet you found earlier to me.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
obeyed and brought the cabinet, pulling out each drawer.</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Something is missing.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
looked shocked. He hadn’t noticed anything missing even though he looked for a
few times now.</p><p>But if he dared
speak that thought out loud, he will definitely be scolded. So Pei Jingzhe only
answered honestly, “I apologize for my slowness. My Lord please enlighten me.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Cosmetics.”</p><p>People who are
able to remain by the Second Commandant’s side definitely would never be too
stupid. Pei Jingzhe immediately connected the dots.</p><p>“There are
veneers in the cabinet, there should also be lipstick and perfume. But the
perfume and fragrance in the carriage is not the same scent that can be found
on those two servants. So there should’ve been another woman, in fact, it’s
very likely a beloved concubine of Yuchi Jinwu. Did she got kidnapped? No,
that’s not right. The cabinet is neither messy nor haphazard. Everything is
placed neatly. When she was taken, it definitely wasn’t out of force…”</p><p>When he reached
here, he exclaimed, “The murderer is the missing woman?!”</p><p>Feng Xiao
flipped his sleeves, “She might not. But she is related to the case. The
murderer used yatagans, but they might not be Turks. Go look into the matter
and report to me in three days.”</p><p>Shocked, Pei
Jingzhe nodded, “Yes sir.”</p><p>…..</p><p>Three days is
not a long time, but it’s not a short time either. The days went by lazily and
it was difficult to sit through them. </p><p>Pei Jingzhe
knew Feng Xiao’s manners. Three days would meant three days exactly. He would
not stand to delay another hour. So at Feng Xiao’s order, he sent out messenger
pigeons on one hand and send men on horses out on the other. The pigeon he sent
out in Qiemo met with a windstorm and never returned. Thankfully, he had
prepared backup plans. On the third day, the men he sent out returned with
letters.</p><p>Feng Xiao spoke
with half lidded eyes, “Speak, speak.” He said.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
replied honestly, “Yuchi Jinwu came to the Central Plains a few years ago, he
met a woman in the City of the Six Crafts by the surname of Qin. After many
pursuits, he took her as his concubine and brought her back to Khotan. The Qin
lady was very loved by Yuchi Jinwu. Each time he comes to Central Plains to
offer tribute, he would bring her along. After the travelling company was
annihilated this time, the woman who was missing, is very likely this Qin
lady.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Is
that all?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
continues, “As to where this Qin lady lives, we have also investigated. It was
a long journey there, but I’ve managed to find something. Her parents are both
deceased, she lived in the house of her aunt. After she left with Yuchi Jinwu,
her aunt also moved with her. According to her neighbours, she’s very
religious. Before she got married, she would always go to the Jade Buddha
Temple and Zixia Taoist Temple. Every month on the first lunar day and on the
fifteen lunar day, she would go there for prayers in person.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
finally widens his eyes, and lets out a ‘hn’ sound, “After speaking so long,
this is the only useful information!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
replied as if he felt wronged, “Then, I also need to finish saying the first
part before I can proceed to the last part! The Jade Buddha Temple had always
been very welcomed and crowded, but the Zixia Taoist Temple is a bit strange.
This temple has been abandoned for very long. You would seldom see any soul
there. If the Qin lady wanted to pray, why not look for a more rowdy temple?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
remain quiet, so he continued, “Something even more strange is that, two months
ago, the Zixia Taoist Temple received a new Master. Immediately, it became
crowded again. Everyone says that the healing arts of the Zixia Temple is
excellent, and the Taoist there is generous and kind. As long as there’s call
for help, he would answer to it.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“What is the name of this new Master, and what is his background?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“His surname is Cui, his full name is Cui Buqu. I heard he’s a travelling
Taoist, but his real background has yet to be discovered.”</p><p><b>Cui Buqu.</b></p><p>To refuse to go
where? And why?</p><p>The earth
beneath the heavens is vast, is there a place forbidden to go?</p><p>Feng Xiao
Clicked his tongue at the name, the corner of his lips curved upwards in a
smirk.</p><p>This is very
interesting indeed.<br>
<br>
<b>Six Crafts: </b>The
six crafts are geotechnical, metalworking, masonry, woodwork, animal worker,
and farming.</p><p><b>Cui Buqu: </b>Cui is a surname. I do not think there is any significance to it.
Buqu (不去) literally means ‘refuse to go’ or ‘not
going’. It’s a very unusual way / strange way to name someone like that.</p><p><b>Yatagan:</b> Long knives belonging to Turks. </p>
