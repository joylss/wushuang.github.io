</p><h2>Chapter 23 – Even If You Would Have Me And Let Me Warm Your Bed….</h2><br><br>
<p>The
City of Six Crafts did not practice curfew. They only closed the gates when
night dawns upon the city, forbidding anyone from going in or out as they
pleased. However, a small county like this is not the same as large cities such
as Beijing. During such a cold weather, other than the <b>gengfu</b>, the streets are deserted, let alone anyone coming out for
supper.</p><p>The
three of them roamed the place for half a day, finally slipping into a
restaurant from kitchen at the back. From behind, Pei Jingzhe knocked out the
kitchen maid that was guarding the kitchen before searching for a few firewood
to start a fire. From the cabinet, he took out some noodles and eggs and made
three bowls of egg noodles—of course, this wasn’t because of the fact that Feng
Xiao was suddenly nice to Cui Buqu, but because he himself was also hungry.</p><p>Cui
Buqu made himself home. He never knew how to write the words ‘shy’, let alone his
behaviour towards someone who poisoned him before. Seeing Pei Jingzhe
approaching them with noodles, he took the fullest bowl and buried his head
into it and ate.</p><p>Feng
Xiao clicked his tongue, “A-Cui, have you ever read the story of ‘KongRong
yielding the pear’?” </p><p>Cui
Buqu did not raise his head, “Are you my elder brother?”</p><p>But
very quickly his cockiness faded. He had chewed the noodles a few times, but
after swallowing it, his eyebrows furrowed tightly.</p><p>“Why
is it so bland? Did you not put salt? Why are the noodles so tough? Did you
scoop it back up after you just put it into the pot?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe looked like he was wronged, “This is my first time in the kitchen.”</p><p>What
he meant was it was good enough that that thing could not kill you.</p><p>Feng
Xiao only added fuel to fire, “Why do you think that I chose the one with the
most soup, and less noodles? The fact that he could make sure the egg is full
cooked is already commendable, just tolerate it a little wouldn’t you!”</p><p>Just
now, when Yu Xiu kidnapped Cui Buqu, although they looked like they were
travelling as a slow speed, the truth is they have already went to the other
side of the Qiushan manor. Cui Buqu could not wait to return to the manor to
eat, so the three of them had to walk around the placed only for half a day
only they could find something to fill their stomachs.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was filled with questions that he could not even care about the egg, he
couldn’t help but asked, “My lord, did the jade really shattered?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “It did. Did you not see it yourself?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “What if, what if that jade was the real one?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao put down the bowl and said slowly, “The people who stole the jade, might
be two different groups of people.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was taken aback, “How did you know?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu said coldly, “Your brain is like your culinary skills: difficult to
describe. In order for the culprit to kill the Khotan ambassador, he had no
other choice but to hide in the city. For him to do that, he would need someone
from the inside.”</p><p>After
being mocked by Cui Buqu, not only did Feng Xiao refused to help him, he even
agreed to it, “If there is someone in the city that belonged to them, it would
be even more difficult for us to search for the real jade. Before this, I
thought that the culprit was in league with the Linlang Alliance’s Wen Liang,
so I wanted to catch the culprit red handed in broad daylight, however, after
Wen Liang’s capture, the jade was still put out for auctioning. So it would
seem that whoever is behind this wanted to use a bogus item to divert our
attention, then send the real one off. However, after the auction today, all
the spies of the House of Blades in the city did not manage to find any traces
of a jade being delivered, so there is only one other possibility.”</p><p>“What
possibility?” Pei Jingzhe followed this trail of thoughts and asked.</p><p>Cui
Buqu could not stand the noodles anymore. Even for the egg, he made a disgusted
face before swallowing it before continuing Feng Xiao’s words.</p><p>“The
ones who murdered and committed the robbery of the jade might be on bad terms
with each other. The real jade was stolen one group, and the other group wanted
to use the bogus jade to lure the other group out, so they can snatch the real
jade back.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe did not understand it at all, “But how would the one who took the real
jade be lured out?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I heard that when other countries from the West brought treasuries to the
Central Plains, to avoid being robbed, they would usually send another item
that heavily resembled the real one, and send them along the road together.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe finally understood. Cui Buqu meant that this time, the Khotan King had
sent two jades: one real and one fake. Tributes are naturally tributes, but
they are definitely also something of value, otherwise it’s impossible to be a
resemblance of the real item. Only Yuchi Jinwu knew which jade was the real
one, and which is fake. So when he died, the culprits took the jade, one group
each. Naturally both parties would be suspicious that the one they’re holding
is the fake one, and the one the other group held is the real one.</p><p>This
theory is a little bit complicated, but when Pei Jingzhe thought more carefully,
he felt that it could be argued. After three to five days when the Khotan’s new
ambassador came, they could finally conclude whether the truth was the way Feng
Xiao and Cui Buqu had theorized. </p><p>But
as of this moment, they still needed to find the jade.</p><p>As
he thought, Pei Jingzhe said, “Master Cui, you mean that, no matter what, since
the jade resurfaced in the Linlang Alliance, the other group would surely send
men to see how the outcome is?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu nodded his head, and felt like the other man was not as stupid as he
thought.</p><p>“So
of the people who came tonight, one of them definitely has connections to the
culprit. I might even say that one of them is even the culprit himself.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe begun to recall, “If I did not recall wrongly, there are six people who
came for the jade. Once the Yunhai Thirteen Stories’ man left, he can be
excluded. Other than the monk and the Turk top martial artist Fo Er, the
Goguryeo man Gao Ning, that woman in yellow robes, there is one more…”</p><p>As
for the last one, Cui Buqu’s recollection of him is incredibly blurry. He only
remembered that the other was wearing a black suit. Whether he was male or
female, Cui Buqu couldn’t even tell, he vaguely remembered that when Fo Er
moved, the other was already gone.</p><p>Feng
Xiao took out three pairs of chopsticks and moved them to face outside.</p><p>“Fo
Er’s goal is to kill me, not for the jade. Although we do not know now why he
wanted me dead, but we can set him aside first.”</p><p>“Gao
Ning and Yu Xiu both came for the jade, but they do not hold any meaning deeper
than that, so it’s not them either.”</p><p>“As
for the woman who was called Bing Xuan……”</p><p>Feng
Xiao turned to look at Cui Buqu.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, of course, knew who she was. “In Jianghu, there is a sect called the
Hehuan Sect that practiced the shuangxiu technique. Bing Xuan is a disciple of
the current sect leader, and according to hearsays, she is incredibly well
received, perhaps she might even succeed as the future sect leader.”</p><p>He
noticed that when Feng Xiao heard of the Hehuan Sect’s name, his expression
yielded a slight change. Although it was very mild, but Cui Buqu somehow
managed to caught it.</p><p>“It
would seem like Lord Feng Er, you know something about the Hehuan Sect?”</p><p>“To
be frank with you, actually the aunt of my eldest uncle of my cousin’s aunt of
the wife of my cousin brother is a disciple of the Hehuan Sect. So I’ve heard
of the name and felt a little familiar.” Feng Xiao smiled as he said.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not yield any emotions, “So the aunt of your eldest uncle of your
cousin’s aunt of the wife of your cousin brother harvests men as a form of
technique to increase your abilities?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Well, after all, it’s said that a woman of thirty are like wolves, and
women of forty years are like tigers. Since she joined the Hehuan Sect, it’s
like releasing a fish back into its waters.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe twitched the corner of his lips, refusing to listen to them talk any
more nonsense and immediately diverted the topic to something else.</p><p>“So
according to what both of you said, Bing Xuan and the other mysterious man is
the most suspicious?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Although the jade is useful for people of Jianghu, and Bing Xuan have
sufficient motives, but if she was one of the culprits and came to investigate
whether this is the real of bogus jade, then there’s no need to present herself
and give her name. She could have hid in the shadows completely.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe thought this was very reasonable, so he watched Feng Xiao turned the
second chopstick to face the other way as well. Now, only the last one remain,
then he knew that Feng Xiao completely agreed with Cui Buqu’s analysis.</p><p>The
most suspicious one would be the mysterious person in black that they didn’t
even know was male or female.</p><p>Feng
Xiao rose to his feet, “When that man left, I’ve sent spies to tail him. Once
we return to the manor, news would be waiting for us.”</p><p>Now
only did Pei Jingzhe know that Feng Xiao had taken such measured.</p><p>Suddenly
he remembered something important.</p><p>“But
my Lord, the jade have already crumbled into dust. If that was the real jade,
then wouldn’t we……”</p><p>Would
they have ran around in circles for nothing?</p><p>Feng
Xiao spared him a glance, but said nothing.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I reckon that you should bring a smarter one next time, to avoid wasting
so much saliva explaining.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao smiled, “With an intelligent person like me present, wouldn’t another
intelligent fellow just be another firefly in the dark?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Since you put it like this, Lord Feng why do you still keep me here. Why
not let me go.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “That cannot do. Although you are not like me, illuminous like the sun
and the moon, but as my side, you are akin to a glistening star. A-Cui, if only
you would consider joining the House of Blades, let alone the Forth Commandant,
if you would have me, and let me warm your bed, I would not decline it.”</p><p>He
even went as far to take Cui Buqu’s hand when he spoke seductively. </p><p>Cui
Buqu was completely disgusted by him, little hairs standing on the back of his
hand. He immediately shoved his hand away, as if he was tainted with specs of
dirt.</p><p>“It
does not matter whether that crumbled jade was the real of the bogus one, if we
pursue the other one now, then that is the real one!”</p><p>As
he listened to his, Pei Jingzhe’s gaze flashed and suddenly understood. </p><p>He
did not care whether this is an old sly fox or not. Whoever Feng Xiao got
interested in, would definitely be someone with rare and worthy capabilities.</p><p>The
three of them returned to the Qiushan manor. The spy who pursued the mysterious
man has indeed returned.</p><p>“My
apologies, when I pursued him midway, he discovered by presence, so I could
only retreat. However, I think he disappeared near the Lu manor.”</p><p>Within
the city, more than a handful people carried the surname ‘Lu’, but there was
only one Lu family that owned a manor. According to rumours, that Lu family is
distantly related to the Fanyang Lu Sect.</p><p>Speaking
about it, it was a coincidence that just this morning, Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu
had just met the Lu cousins in the restaurant.</p><p>Both
of them exchanged glances when they listened to the spy’s report.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “A-Cui, what was the name of her cousin again?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, &nbsp;“Su Xing.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “From the perspective of the other side, it seems likely to be the Lu
family. Let us take a look.”</p><p>It
was cold in the middle of the night, but he immediately got up and begun
heading towards the Lu manor to investigate.</p><p>Cui
Buqu said coldly, “Lord Feng, I had just ate the egg noodles your subordinate
made, now I am feeling a bit of a stomach egg, and I feel like vomiting blood.
Could you not give a little way and pity me?”</p><p>A
word to beg for mercy had to involve him, so Pei Jingzhe could only remained
silent as he got shot for the cold arrow one after the other, taking a few
steps back, refusing to participate in the war.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Since when are you so delicate, you could even stand the Naihe drug, but
could not stand just a meagre bowl of egg noodles? Jingzhe, go to the kitchen
and get a few dumplings for Master Taoist Cui to warm his stomach, then we are
heading to the Lu manor.”</p><p>Who
knew that Cui Buqu really opened his mouth and vomited on him.</p><p>Both
of them stood incredibly close, so Feng Xiao was unable to move away. He could
smell the stench rushing towards him, but what Cui Buqu vomited wasn’t blood,
it was the egg noodles that he ate just now.</p><p>This
was even worse than blood.</p><p>At
the moment, the colour on his face was drained completely.</p><p><b>Gengfu</b></p><p>: An occupation in ancient China. The gengfu
roams the city at night and hits the gong to tell the time of the day. I am not
sure if there is an English term for it.
