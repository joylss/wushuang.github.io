</p><h2>Chapter 21 – You Took My Lover, Can I Not Act Faster?</h2><br><br>

<p>In
the blink of an eye, Cui Buqu fell into the hands of the man in white. The man
in white placed a hand gently on his shoulder, yet it was also heavy at the
same time, causing Cui Buqu to felt that half his shoulder had gone numb.</p><p>His
throat was itchy, like a feather was tickling the same spot over and over
again, causing him to be unable to hold it in and coughed. Once he coughed, it
affected his shoulder and pain spread throughout his body, radiating throughout
his abdomen and limbs.</p><p>When
the man in white saw how he exuded cold sweat, he could not help but extends a
hand to hold him.</p><p>“Are
you still all right?” His voice was gentle and soft, as if he was speaking to
an old friend. “Judging by the way you walk, it is the symptoms of being
poisoned. Tch, what benefits comes for you to drag a sickly body like that and
still intend on helping the House of Blades to look for the jade? Why not
consider joining me, I will neutralize the poison for you and reinstall your
freedom. It will save you the unfortunate place of needing to choose.” </p><p>Cui
Buqu raised his head, sharp gaze penetrating through the night and its veils,
glaring at his adversary in the eye. The man in white did not avoid his gaze, he
looked back at him frankly with a smile, kind and gentle.</p><p>On
the other side, Feng Xiao exclaimed an ‘aiya’, “With both my lover and
subordinate being caught, who should I save first? This is deliberately making
me choose!”</p><p>Fo
Er did not allow himself to be distracted by his speech. He continued to
deliver one attack after the next, carrying an aura of viciousness and
completely surrounding Feng Xiao, killing off any opportunity for him to
escape. As for himself, he leaped into the air and threw a punch at Feng Xiao
with the palm of his hand.</p><p>His
punch came like strong winds and rolling waves, like the shore returning to
take vengeance of men on land. It would be practically impossible for one to
step back or avoid it, putting them in a very crucial position. In front of
them is a deep abyss, and the earth was crumbling behind their backs. At that
moment they could fell into a pit of no return.</p><p>This
technique had been the very first technique that Fo Er invented shortly after
he became a martial artist, and it was also his most famous technique. He gave
it a name, Qiluo, that meant ‘unsurpassed’. It was Qiluo that has beaten many
high masters from the Central Plains. Today, using this technique, he was
determined to claim victory, wanted it to take Feng Xiao’s life on the spot.</p><p>“It
would seem like Lord Feng would be unable to come to your aid.” The man in
white smiled, taking Cui Buqu’s arm and raised it into the air. Cui Buqu felt a
sharp pain surging through his entire upper body, and suddenly he was lifted
into the air. </p><p>Seeing
this, Gao Ning snorted briefly, took Pei Jingzhe and left as well.</p><p>Just
as Fo Er’s palm was aiming towards Feng Xiao, Feng Xiao raised his sleeves and
flourished, the zither flew into the air and hold Fo Er’s hand in the air. The
sound of its string rang and the zither shook violently, yet it showed no
signed of cracking apart, instead, the sound of the zither slowed down Fo Er’s
advancement. Feng Xiao took the chance as the zither fell, allowing it to fall
into his arms as he leaped into the air and stopped right in front of Fo Er,
using the zither to slap it right into the other.</p><p>Fo
Er was taken by surprise and immediately stepped back, but the zither was like
a rolling storm. In the blink of an eye, it dissolved the power in his core,
spreading through his limbs and internal organs, washing away any form of
flowing energy. Fo Er tasted something in his mouth, and suddenly blood spilled
from the corner of his lips.</p><p>He
wiped away the blood and glared at his opponent coldly.</p><p>Feng
Xiao looked like he had not taken any damage. Not only that, but he did not
even spare a glance in Cui Buqu and Pei Jingzhe’s direction. He resumed to push
himself up with his hand and locked with gaze with Fo Er.</p><p>“Your
martial arts are not bad, it’s considered akin to the master’s level, however,
it is indeed unfortunate that you ran into me.” Feng Xiao laughed slyly, “If
everyone is destined to cross paths with an enemy, then I am he who is sent by
god to test you. Although you are talented, but when you meet someone like me
who is a genius, then you can only admit to fate. Go back to your grassy lands
and train for another three to five years, then perhaps we might have a closer
match?”</p><p>Fo
Er breathed slowly. Just now, Feng Xiao’s retaliation had gave him some
internal wounded, even now, his chest was still hurting badly. He knew that
Feng Xiao was also wounded a little, but it is most likely only a very faint
external wound. If compared, he had already lose this match.</p><p>He
knew he definitely could not kill Feng Xiao this night. </p><p>Originally,
since everyone came today and there would be other people to disturb the
quietness, his goal could have been achieved easily, yet those people only
cared about the jade. They only stood at the side lines and observed, &nbsp;or when the situation is not to their favour,
they would just up and leave, otherwise they just grab hold of Feng Xiao’s
people and hold then hostage, but none of them wanted to actually fight head on
with Feng Xiao.</p><p>In
the end, he only had himself to blame—that he was not as powerful as his
opponent.</p><p>“A
fighter should have no distraction in his heart, only could he achieve the
highest level of martial arts. &nbsp;However,
tonight, your heart is not in it. I refuse to fight an opponent such as this.”
Fo Er replied coldly, turned around and left. Although his martial arts are
mainly heavy and explosive, they could also be light. In the blink of an eye,
he was already miles away, quickly swallowed up by the night.</p><p>The
reason he said those words was simply to save his pride. The number one martial
artist of Khan Ishbara of the Turks definitely needed his pride.</p><p>Feng
Xiao did not pursue him.</p><p>As
he watched the other disappeared from his sight and concealed the flippant look
on his face, he turned and quickly ran into the manor.</p><p>Not
surprisingly, the Qiushan manor was in a complete mess. The servants all had
hidden themselves, not daring to say anything. After they saw that Feng Xiao
had returned, only did they crawled out from beneath the table shivering and
complained to him.</p><p>“My
lord, just now when you were outside, two men forced their way in and tore down
everything. We had no idea what they wanted to find, but when they left, they
held nothing in their hands, as if they did not manage to find it!”</p><p>Feng
Xiao responded with an ‘En’. It could only be that the others came to the
conclusion that the jade that was destroyed just now had been a bogus item, so
they wanted to look for the real jade.</p><p>As
for the real Jade of Heaven’s Lake……</p><p>Feng
Xiao’s lips turned downwards, flaunting a sardonic smile.</p><p>No
matter what expression was on the face of someone beautiful, it would be
undoubtedly different from the others. The servants, although they were filled
with fear and shock, could not help but look up and stared at him.</p><p>…...</p><p>The
man in white took Cui Buqu with him, yet he didn’t move too fast. If Cui Buqu
was hurt on the shoulder, added with his old illness acting up, he felt as if
the other was simply taking a companion for a light jog.</p><p>The
sound of the night gong came from the distance, everywhere little candles were
being lit up and the dark dawns upon them. The night was slowly rising in
temperature, and although Cui Buqu was wearing enough clothes, he still felt
cold, and couldn’t help himself sneezing.</p><p>“You
are not a man of Jianghu.” Cui Buqu coughed twice, his voice was coarse.</p><p>He
guessed that a fever was settling in for him, for his entire body felt sore and
painful. He felt the need to look for a bed and lie down for a while.</p><p>Yet
the world if difficult to outwit. Look where he was, following someone he did
not even know playing a game with him.</p><p>The
man in white smiled, “If I am not, are you one?</p><p>It
was as if Cui Buqu did not hear what he said, he answered himself, “Tonight you
came for the crowd, so naturally, you also came for the jade. However, if you
are not a man of Jianghu, then you have no need for its powers. They do not
interest you. For someone like you, pleasant and kind on the surface, but you
carry an air of arrogant, you are definitely not someone who would serve just anybody.
However, for your come here on your master’s behalf, it could only mean that
the man behind you is someone who is very powerful. Therefore, the reason you
wanted that jade, is probably to bring it back to this master of yours.”</p><p>The
man in white, “Did anyone tell you before, that intelligent people have short
lives.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu replied blandly, “You need not tell me so much nonsense. Just four words
will do: Normal people envy geniuses.”</p><p>The
man in white laughed, “Master Taoist Cui, you are too, too interesting. If only
you and I hadn’t meet in such an inconvenient time, I think I will definitely bring
you out to tea and watch the scenery.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Then I might not be able to drink that tea, nor see that scenery.”</p><p>The
man in white did not respond, but he said suddenly, “Are you hungry? At this
hour, is there anything in the city to eat? Let me bring you to look for a nice
bowl of hot soup.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “My shoulder hurts. I am not hungry.”</p><p>The
man in white smiled, “If you refuse to bring me, your shoulder would hurt even
more.”</p><p>The
way he spoke is incredibly polite without even a hint of anger, but his
techniques were crueller than anyone he had met.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “If I refuse to bring you, someone would bring you.”</p><p>The
man in white smiled, “Who?”</p><p>“Me,
of course.”</p><p>Following
the words, a man walked out. He was tall, and his footsteps stopped a long
distance away from there they stood, his back straight and upright.</p><p>“Lord
Feng, how quick are you to have arrived. The number one fighter of Turk was
chased away by you so easily?” The white robed man replied in surprise.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Of course not. You took my lover, can I not act faster?”</p>
