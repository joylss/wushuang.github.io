<br><h2>Chapter 4 – My Name is Feng Xiao, I hail from the House of Blades</h2><br><br>
<p>The assassin
was determined in achieve what he came here to do.</p><p>Before the
sword pierce between his target’s eyebrows, he was already imagining the
victory of having the other’s head in his hands. </p><p>This sword
could shatter gold and slice jade. Even if the bones are tough, they’re nothing
in comparison to the sword’s unyielding steel.</p><p>The assassin
originally did not want to deal with this personally—a weak and fragile sickly
person. However, he could not refuse the orders of his superiors. If this
sickly man does not die, then it would be him who does.</p><p>If nothing goes
wrong, in the next moment, the sword would pierce the spot between that
person’s eyebrows with fresh blood rolling down the wound, trickling like a
little river down his nose. This person’s face is as pale as a ghost. It’s no
doubt that he’s been ill for many years. But for the colour of blood and his
skin to contrast each other, it’s definitely a view to admire.</p><p>The assassin
thought secretly to himself. He’s seen these type of scenes for far too many
times. It’s because this Cui person’s looks aren’t bad, it made him eager for
the aftermath after the job is done.</p><p>Yet, all his
plans failed in the next second.</p><p>The assassin’s
eyes widen as he glared at the hand that came out of nowhere.</p><p>This is a hand
that was clearly strong, its nails were clean and neat, his bones were perfect
and healthy. The colour of his skin was even and fair. Had it been for any
other day, the assassin would have severed such a hand and admire it for a few
days before throwing it away.</p><p>But now, he
does not have the desire to admire the hand. Because it had became a curse to
him, with a twitch of two fingers, it broke his sword in half! The assassin
gave a look of disbelief, but his was swift in his actions. Those whose life
often hangs by a thread were long used trusting their instincts. He managed to
avoid a fist aimed towards him.</p><p>Yet this is
only the beginning. His adversary was clad in white and pursued him
relentlessly. With only his hands, he could spar with the assassin on equal
grounds, despite the later holding a sword. As both of them engaged in a fight,
their moves were too quick for normal people to follow with their eyes.
However, their fight was so furious that many people were thrown to the ground.
</p><p>Originally the
temple was filled with people, but right now everyone had ran away. The only
few people left were junior Taoists, but even they have ran to hide behind a
pillar. Master Cui was scared stiff, sitting where he was and unable to move.</p><p>With only one
look, the assassin knew that he would not win against the man before his eyes. </p><p>With this
thought in mind, the assassin grits his teeth and made a decision.</p><p>He used the
broken sword and toss it against the man with one tenth of his strength. At
least, he could delay his adversary and buy time for himself.</p><p>But this time
is not enough for him to escape, so the assassin lunged himself at the person
sitting on the ground.</p><p>He was as swift
as a shadow. &nbsp;Master Cui widens his eyes,
both hands pressed on the ground. He wanted to get up, but due to his body not
responding after the shock, he could not avoid the assassin in time. </p><p>“You traitor!
Today, you will definitely die!”</p><p>He’s not sure
whether it was his actions or those words, but Master Cui’s face turned pale
even more, letting out even a few coughs.</p><p>Suddenly, the
assassin could no longer move. Turning his gaze downwards, he saw that a broken
sword has pierced through his chest. Blood trickled down, and in that drop of
blood, were words of ridicule said against him, not allowing him to die in
peace.</p><p>Using a foot, Feng
Xiao rolled the assassin’s corpse to the side. As he glares at the blood stain
on the ground, he took a detour around the blood stain, appearing before the
Master Cui who has yet recovered from his shock.</p><p>“Are you Cui
Buqu?”</p><p>From the way he
stood, tall and mighty, his back against the light. He looked as if he’s
questioning a prisoner.</p><p>The junior
Taoists finally returned to their senses and ran out of their hiding place.</p><p>Cui Buqu coughs
for a few times and stood as the juniors helped him up. He wore a simple robe,
his gaze levelling with this adversary.</p><p>“Yes, I am Cui
Buqu. Many thanks for saving me. Pray tell, may I ask for your name?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
walked a few steps forward, walking up the dais. The sun shone atop of his
head, bringing out his handsome features.</p><p>Cui Buqu
travelled everywhere. He’s met more people than the number of grains he ate,
but Feng Xiao manage to make him lost his focus for a second.</p><p>The other has
sharp eyes, &nbsp;as if they could materialize
themselves in front of him and burn two holes into his body. Cui Buqu could
feel that very feeling on him.</p><p>“May I ask if
anything I’ve spoken was out of place? If so, I am still grateful for your
rescue.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Why
did he desire to kill you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu shook
his head, “I have no idea who he is.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Before he died, he claimed you a traitor.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I
have definitely never met him. I do not know why he said that either, perhaps
he mistook me for someone.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
smiled faintly, “Zixia Temple is not the only temple in the city, and you are
neither the only Taoist. Why did he not mistook others, but you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu’s
complexion paled, “Then you should ask him. How would I know?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
replied coldly, “It’s impossible to ask a dead person. Therefore, I can only
ask those who are still alive. Guards!”</p><p>As soon as he
spoke, seven to eight men surrounded the entire courtyard.</p><p>Two men walked
forth and captured Cui Buqu as well as all the juniors present in the area.</p><p>There was no
struggle. There was no need to.</p><p>Cui Buqu said
angrily, “Who are you people, how could you simply capture anyone you wish! Has
Sui become so lawless?!”</p><p>“You are
correct. As long as I suspect anyone, I can capture them. Do you not want to
know who I am?”</p><p>Feng Xiao took
a step forward, held Cui Buqu’s chin before lifting it upwards to look at him
in the eye.</p><p>“I will only
say this once, so remember it well. I am Feng Xiao, I hail from the House of
Blades.”</p><p>…..</p><p>When the Sui
Emperor ascended the throne, he created the three departments and the six
ministries. </p><p>Other than that,
he felt the Central Plains and the Turks were in a state of chaos. So in order
to secure his power, he established the House of Blades, together with the six
ministries, they would only answer to him. Even though their task is highly
confidential and few people knew of them, the House of Blades held immense
power, even to the degree that they are allowed to take action first before
seeking approval from the emperor.</p><p>Within the
House of Blades, there is a Blade Stone gifted by the Sui Emperor himself. Those
who held no position court, sometimes even the princes themselves, were not
allowed to enter the House of Blades without relieving themselves of their
swords. This is how special the House of Blades is.</p><p>This incident
of the Khotan ambassador’s murder in the Central Plain held a special priority.
They feared that people at court would conspire among themselves, so they
assigned a special ambassador from the House of Blades to retrieve the Khotan
royalty. Because of this, Feng Xiao was sent here, but he hadn’t expect to be
one step too late—the Khotan royalty was murdered outside the City of the Six
Crafts, a woman with him had gone missing, as well as a tribute list.</p><p>The culprit had
stolen the tribute list, it’s no doubt he also took one item that was recorded
on the tribute list.</p><p>Khotan
possessed many beautiful jades and rare jewels. Whatever that valuable item is,
it has something to do with jade. Feng Xiao operates within the House of Blades
and knew of many strange worldly matters. He knew of the Tianchi Yudan of the
Khotan Kingdom. He guessed that that was the missing tribute they were after. </p><p>However, this
only made the case more complicated.</p><p>The culprit had
plotted this for some time. Perhaps it could be the Turks, but it can also be
the Turks getting mixed up simply to create a smokescreen. </p><p>The man that
was sent to Khotan has yet to send a reply, so Feng Xiao directed his attention
on the City of Six Crafts, on the Taoist who became famed within two months of
moving here.</p><p>“May I ask,
what alliance is the House of Blades in the pugilist world? I am a man with no
power or money, and I seldom interact with people from the pugilist world. What
have I done to offend you people?”</p><p>Cui Buqu got
taken back to Qiushan Manor. The other man did not interrogate him harshly, and
he did not lock him up—of course, he didn’t need to. Cui Buqu is just an
ordinary person with no martial art skills.</p><p>He sat opposite
of Feng Xiao, face to face. Between them there was even a pot of hot tea, as if
two friends were catching up on old times. Cui Buqu was shocked just a moment
ago, the fact that he was almost killed felt like a dream.</p><p>Feng Xiao told
him lazily, “As a disciple of the Glass Palace in Fangzhang province, you have
no idea what is the House of Blades?”</p><p>He took out a
jade pendant as big as two fingers and toss it before Cui Buqu.</p><p>“This was found
under your pillow. I imagine Master Taoist Cui, you can cut out the feigned
innocence?”</p><p>The Glass
Palace in Fangzhang province is an independent alliance. Its disciples do not
engage in pugilist worldly matters. A few of them have also taken their place
in the Central Plains, living as a vagabond among common men. The most
important thing is that the Glass Palace’s disciples knew practically
everything beneath the skies. Since Cui Buqu is a disciple of the Glass Place,
even if the House of Blade is a secretive agency, it’s impossible that he
hasn’t heard anything about it.</p><p>Cui Buqu
sighed. “To be honest, I have heard of the House of Blades, but I am but a
simple man and I do not deal with imperial officials. If I pretend to be
ignorant, it would save me a lot of trouble. And, you’ve mistaken. I’m not a
disciple of the Glass Palace. I have a senior who is, though. He was formerly a
tutor of mine, so for convenience, he gave me the jade pendant so I could visit
him freely.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
raised his eyebrows. “In that case, from which alliance do you hail? You are a
Taoist, to learn how to play as such with words, do you not feel that you’ve
shamed your ancestors?”</p><p>Cui Buqu
replied honestly. “What choice do I have? Taoists needs food to survive too. If
my speech isn’t convincing enough, how would Zixia Taoist Temple have the glory
it has today?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Who
is Qin Miaoyu to you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Who
is that?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The
Khotan ambassador was murdered, his concubine—Qin Miaoyu is now missing. Before
she was wedded, she was a citizen of the City of the Six Crafts. She loved to
visit the Jade Buddha Temple and the Zixia Taoist Temple. Two months ago, you
came to Zixia Taoist Temple and brought it back to glory itself. Judging by
your abilities, you could’ve went to any temple you wanted to, but why Zixia
Taoist Temple?”</p><p>He was forceful
as he spoke, and his body kept moving forward, getting closer and closer to Cui
Buqu. Cui Buqu wanted to move backwards, but he was held down on his shoulder.</p><p>“The scent of
Plum Blossoms.” Feng Xiao’s nose was near the other man’s neck. He spoke in a
low voice, “This is the same scent in Yuchi Jinwu’s carriage. What is your
relationship with his concubine? Or let’s say, you masqueraded as a woman, and
murdered him?”</p><p>Cui Buqu
laughed, “Look at me. Even if I masqueraded as a woman, no one would really
believe it, would they? If you wear a woman’s outfit, it might suit you more
than it does me. As to your plum blossom scent. Today there are a lot of people
at the temple. I don’t even recall how many people I’ve spoken to, so what if
their scent lingered on me?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
glared at him.</p><p>Although the
other man pushed all his responsibilities away cleanly and feigned innocence,
Feng Xiao does not currently have any evidence against him. However, the way
Cui Buqu reacted was too calm, it was a bit suspicious.</p><p>What did Cui
Buqu did before he came to Zixia Taoist Temple, and where he came from. How did
he share a relationship with a member of the Glass Palace from Fangzhang
Province. Everything is blurry and makes little sense. </p><p>“I see Master
Cui, you’ve decided not to be frank?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
pushed him away, allowing the other man to be caught off guard before turning around.</p><p>He brushed his
clothes as if he’s afraid that the dust on Cui Buqu’s body would stain his
clothes.</p><p>“Do you know
why I brought you to this house?”</p>
