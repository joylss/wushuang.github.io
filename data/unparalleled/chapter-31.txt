<h2>Chapter 31 – I Will Be Strike By Thunder And Drink Rancid Water Everyday, When I Leave My House, I Will Break My Leg Running</h2>
<br><br>

<p>All his life, Feng Xiao
rarely encountered situation where he was in a difficult state.</p><p>Since he was young, he
possessed a talent that others did not have. He excelled in both martial
artists and academics. All around him, people were envious. Even in the House
of Blades, he was incredibly favoured by the Emperor, who granted him the sort
of power to do whatever he wished no matter where he went. No one could make
him bend the knee. Even during difficult situations, with someone of his calibre,
it would not have proved very difficult for him to solve.</p><p>Only this time and this
time alone, he was overly dependent, because of a moment of carelessness, he
fell into a pit someone laid for him. Although this isn’t dangerous as to cause
him to lose his life, but it was enough to stomp on his pride, allowing
Commander Feng Er to realize he wasn’t all powerful.</p><p>But luckily, the most
unfortunate victim from this is not him.</p><p>When someone is in a foul
mood, and then they think about someone who is more unfortunate than them,
their mood would take a turn for the better.</p><p>So Feng Xiao looked at an
unconscious Cui Buqu and couldn’t help but begin to hum a small tune.</p><p>“If you refuse to wake up
still, I am going to leave you here and go back to the city myself.”</p><p>“Actually, when I look
closely at your face, even though you are not as dashing as myself, your looks
would have stood out in a crowd.”</p><p>“Cui Buqu, Cui Buqu, <b>no matter how people cui you, you just refuse
to go</b>. This is perhaps not your real name.”</p><p>Feng Xiao leaned against
a rocky cliff, squinting his eyes as he watched the sun rise in the west,
layers of clouds tainted by its radiant gold. Especially watching from this
height, the scenery was indeed beautiful, like a gathering of golden cotton
balls, soundlessly illustrating a thousand hundreds of meadows and valleys. </p><p>He used the heel of his
foot to nudge Cui Buqu that was laid sprawled by his side.</p><p>“A beautiful scenery like
this, is it not a pity that you missed the chance to see it?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, of course, did
not respond to him.</p><p>If there is still some
consciousness left in him, he would have picked up a rock and shove it into
Feng Xiao’s mouth to prevent him rambling more.</p><p>But right now he could
only sleep peacefully next to Feng Xiao, if it wasn’t for the sunlight that
shone upon his face, drawing the wrinkled lines on his forehead, he looked like
someone who was in a deep sleep that refused to wake up.</p><p>Feng Xiao practically
waived all Pei Jingzhe’s salary for the next five years, yet he hasn’t appeared,
so he lets out a sigh and begins to consider relocate Pei Jingzhe in one of the
strongholds the House of Blades have in <b>Qiemo
City.</b></p><p>“You don’t look so well,
let me help you.” Feng Xiao said. There was no clue to what he was thinking,
but a look of excitement floated on his face, “<b>In the past, they used enjoy drawing eyebrows, </b>and now we exercise
the art of face painting, these two are quite similar.” </p><p>Cui Buqu felt something
on his face and looked as if he wanted to open his eyes, but he did not have
the strength to.</p><p>But he was never someone
who gave up so easily, many times when the Heavens wanted to take his life from
him, they somehow still give him a silver of hope, and every time when he
scrambled back up, even on the long lonely road to the afterlife, he would
always crawl his way back from Hell’s gate.</p><p>He had never lost before.</p><p>This time, it would be
the same.</p><p>What greeted his eyes
were a blanket of clear, azure blue, clouds a thousand miles away, and yellow
sand mixed with white snow. </p><p>And also, an incredibly
handsome face.</p><p>“You are awake.” Feng
Xiao said, he sounded happy, “How are you feeling now?”</p><p>Cui Buqu tried to move
his fingers, but felt it was like usual—weak and lacking of strength—so he
could only remain laid on his back like a corpse.</p><p>Perhaps it had something
to do with the sunrise, because he did not feel cold now, the clear breeze sweeping
on the surface of his skin, his face felt refreshed, and his heart is at peace,
this is something he hasn’t felt before.</p><p>If a certain person was
not at his side, that would have been the best.</p><p>“Are you thirsty?” asked
Feng Xiao.</p><p>Of course he is. After
one day and one night without water, Cui Buqu could feel his throat burning.</p><p>But he knew that Feng
Xiao would not grant his wish so easily.</p><p>As he expected, the other
laughed slyly, “Call me three times ‘Dad’, then I will melt some snow for you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu wasn’t eager to
claim his revenge yet, but he would wait for that opportunity. He opened his
mouth and called ‘Dad’ three times quickly, finishing it before the other could
blink.</p><p>His voice was hoarse and
it was not melodious to the ear, but he still did it.</p><p>Feng Xiao used a hand to
scoop up the snow from the ground, holding it before using his inner strength
to melt it into water, then bringing it to Cui Buqu’s lips.</p><p>Cui Buqu wasn’t picky
like Feng Xiao, who wouldn’t have drank these water that contained sand. As he took
a few mouthfuls, he felt his throat a lot better.</p><p>“My dad is dead.” Cui
Buqu said.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “……”</p><p>Because of how the other
is in such an unpleasant condition, Feng Xiao decided that he would not argue
with him.</p><p>After all, if Cui Buqu
really died, he would not find another person as interesting as him.</p><p>“Give me more.” Before he
drank anything, he found that he could sustain it, but once he started
drinking, he craved for more.</p><p>“It’s so dirty. You could
still stand to drink it.” Feng Xiao twitched his lips, but nevertheless he
scooped a handful of snow and fed him.</p><p>“I’ve drank water worse
than this.” Cui Buqu said plainly, “After a big rain, those water at the side,
have you seen those? People walking here and there, their shoes bringing sand,
all sank into those water, even for that kind, I have drank before.”</p><p>Compared to this, snow
water really is a hundred more times cleaner.</p><p>When a person reached his
limit, never mind muddy water, even if someone’s left over food, they could
still bare to swallow it.</p><p>But Cui Buqu never
thought those were something to brag about, so when he spoke of them, he was as
if he was simply entertaining a normal conversation, as if he was talking about
what he ate today.</p><p>Feng Xiao suddenly said, “Commander
Cui.”</p><p>Cui Buqu blinked, but his
face yielded no emotions.</p><p>But because of that
blink, it was enough for Feng Xiao to gather that his theory was not incorrect.</p><p>“The great Commander of
the Zuoyue Bureau spying at my side for so long. In order to thwart the case,
he even willingly lets us use the Naihe drug on him, this really made me see
you in a whole new light!”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Would the
Commander of the Zuoyue Bureau put himself in danger and allow you to drag him
here, that would have even cost his own life?”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled
knowingly, “Had it been others, perhaps not, but for you, you definitely would.
Someone like you would not allow anyone to take a step back, and would refuse
to bend the knee. If the Zuoyue Bureau has someone like you, then no one could
rule over your head. Master Taoist Cui, you’ve had me fooled for so long, you
really are incredibly patient!”</p><p>Since there was no room for
him to look for an excuse, Cui Buqu did not forcefully look for one.</p><p>“Even the patriarch of
the House of Blades came to the outskirts of the city himself, with the sickly
fool I am, is it anything special?”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled, “If I
killed you here, no one would even find out or know. At that time, when a
corpse is dumped and allowed itself to be blown by the sand and wind, even if
someone found you, they would not be able to find any evidence. From then on,
the Zuoyue Bureau and the House of Blades can no longer fight for the same powers.
What do you think of that?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “This is not a
bad idea. But I am not the only one with talent in the world. If the Zuoyue
Bureau loses me, a new Commander will show up. If you killed me, it seemed
pointless.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “But not quite
everyone is nearly as intelligent as you are. Even with your body’s condition,
you still could dig such a pit for me to fall into. If you are gone, I am a lot
more well off.”</p><p>As he spoke, he reached out
to hold Cui Buqu’s neck.</p><p>Cui Buqu looked
indifferent, watching the other’s face, he looked like he was even calmer than
the sky itself, as if the other’s actions were unrelated to him.</p><p>……</p><p>After Qiao Xian and
Zhangsun found out that Cui Buqu was taken by Feng Xiao, they stopped at
nothing to rush to the Hulin forest. Naturally, Pei Jingzhe followed behind
them, but once they arrived at the Hulin forest, the place was practically
barren. They could only find traces of a fight taking place.</p><p>Now they could care less
about their differences. At the moment, they set them aside and spilt into
three groups to search.</p><p>But at that moment, the
winds and snow are rising and refusing to stop. Qiao Xian and the rest knew
martial arts, so they could save themselves, but the bigger the winds, the more
worried they are. Qiao Xian was even worried that Feng Xiao would use Cui Buqu
as a meat shield, and that it has already happened.</p><p>The forest was overgrown
and wild, and stretches as far as the eye could see, as if there was no end to
it. They search from dusk to dawn until the snow storm stopped, only did Qiao
Xian manage to find two figures next to a boulder that was buried in white
snow.</p><p>Feng Xiao looked fine,
sitting upright although a few tendons were broken, but he still looked awake,
looking at them lazily, completely unsurprised that Qiao Xian and Zhangsun
showed up. </p><p>“It’s about time you
people show up, another step late, I fear your Master Taoist Cui is going to
freeze into a corpse.”</p><p>Qiao Xian felt that it
was better if he hadn’t looked, but once she did, her expression changed and
her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Cui Buqu’s forehead,
temples, even his neck, was written full of words.</p><p>The strength used to
write them were quite powerful, with elegant and stylish curves like it’s
written by a famous artist, but this is not the main point of it. </p><p>The main point was the
content.</p><p><i>“I, Cui Buqu, owe Feng Xiao a favour for saving my
life. From today onwards, I will call him my Father, as proof, if I refuse to
abide by this promise, I will be struck by thunder and drink rancid water every
day, and if I left my house, I will break my legs running.”</i></p><p>Before Qiao Xian could
wipe off those words, behind her Pei Jingzhe already read them out loud.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi’s eyebrows
and lips all twitched like they were in a cramp.</p><p>He bent down, wanting to
rub the words off Cui Buqu’s face, but he quickly discovered it was incredibly
difficult to wipe them off.</p><p>Feng Xiao stood at the
side and laughed wickedly, “Don’t waste your strength. These sort of soil can
be found everywhere here. If I melt them down and use them to write, it makes
them very difficult to come off. Just now I even tried a few times to make sure
they’ll stay for a while, only I wrote them on his face. If the fact that I
saved his life is so easily rubbed off, how could I emphasize how privileged he
is?”</p><p>To that, Cui Buqu rolled
his eyes.</p><p>Qiao Xian did not even
speak, drawing her sword she aimed it at Feng Xiao, before she was quickly
stopped by Pei Jingzhe. Those two men with him rushed forward to defend Feng
Xiao when they saw a scene was about to erupt.</p><p>“Bring me back.” Cui Buqu
said, “Zhangsun, give me your bamboo hat.”</p><p>Zhangsun removed that
bamboo hat that had always followed him around, and helped Cui Buqu put it on
before carrying him onto his back.</p><p>Feng Xiao did not stop
him, he even waved his hand. “Master Taoist Cui, take care. Two days later, I
will visit you. Do not forget about me.”</p><p>Cui Buqu snorted, “I won’t
even forget it after eight lifecycles!”</p><p>Whatever happened between
these two, it seemed that it would take some time to sort them out.</p><p>……</p><p>Qiao Xian could feel
that, after he found herself and Zhangsun, Cui Buqu looked a lot more relaxed.
Perhaps it was difficult for outsiders to notice, but she had followed Cui Buqu
for so long now, she knew what he liked and hated. For someone who held his
guard at all times like Cui Buqu, it was very difficult for him to let his
guard lose. She and Zhangsun were both fortunate exceptions.</p><p>They did not bother about
the House of Blades. Once Zhangsun and Qiao Xian found the man they wanted,
they left. Feng Xiao did not stop them—he also needed some time to recover
himself.</p><p>At this moment, the case
of the Khotan murder was still unsolved, and the Jade of Heaven’s Lake has yet
to be found. The Turk who went after Cui Buqu, after much of his manipulation,
had turned his focus onto Feng Xiao, but was chased out of the city by the same
person. Yet on his way out of the city, he was surrounded on all three corners,
he practically lost. Between the Zuoyue Bureau and the House of Blades, none of
them won, at the moment, both sides retreated, engraved this mark into memory,
so it could be avenged later.</p><p>On the way back, Cui Buqu
fell asleep on Zhangsun’s back.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi walked
steadily on the way, carefully kept his shoulders steady so Cui Buqu would not
even feel an inch of bumpiness.</p><p>“The Commander seemed to
have been poisoned.” Qiao Xian said in a low voice.</p><p>Zhangsun replied with an ‘En’,
he had already smelt the strange smell in the air. “It’s the Naihe drug.”</p><p>Qiao Xian displayed a
look of despair, then it turned into anger, “It’s the House of Blades. How dare
they really!” </p><p>Zhangsun did not utter a
word.</p><p>Feng Xiao actively rebelled,
whether he was good or evil, it was difficult for one to say. Such hearsays of
him is already long prevalent and widespread. So the fact that he used such
methods to deal with the Commander is not strange at all.</p><p>“Don’t go around causing
a scene. Wait for the Commander to wake up before acting. He might have plotted
something for this matter.” </p><p>But this time, Cui Buqu
slept for a whole two days.</p><p>When he woke up, he felt
his body weak all over—there wasn’t a single place he didn’t feel sore.</p><p>Only his brain was awake,
perhaps this also means that he had rested enough. Once he opened his eyes, he
called for Qiao Xian and Zhangsun.</p><p>“Within these two days,
did anything happen? Had Khan Apa’s ambassador arrived?”</p><p>A female servant came
with some chicken soup. Cui Buqu refused to be fed, so he sat up to listen as
he ate.</p><p>Two of them had long
investigated everything they wanted to investigate, so they were only waiting
for him to wake up—so they could report it.</p><p>Qiao Xian, “Khan Apa’s
ambassador had already arrived yesterday night. We have already settled them
down. Once you wake up, a meeting can be arranged.”</p><p>Cui Buqu nodded, “The
House of Blades, are they on the move?”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “Feng Xiao
ordered County Magistrate Zhao to lock down the entire city to search for the
Goguryeon woman that fought with us that night, Qin Miaoyu; on the other hand,
something happened to the Lu manor, it was on the night you and Feng Xiao went
to the outskirts of the city, Lu Ti’s daughter drowned and passed away. Her
body is now still in the city’s bureau. Feng Xiao is looking for Qin Miaoyu, so
he let people surround the Lu manor, forbidding them to take a step out. It’s
said that Lu Ti is incredibly furious and had wrote a letter to his distant
relative in the Fanyang Lu Sect to ask for their help against the House of
Blades.”</p><p>When she came here, she
stopped for a while, “There is something else, yesterday night I saw the number
one fighter of Turk, Fo Er, in the city. He noticed me, so I did not follow
him.”</p><p>Even though the city is
currently in a lock down state, but with top martial artists like Fo Er and Gao
Ning, it was not difficult for them to sneak in.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “He must have
been aware of the Khan’s ambassador’s arrival, and discovered that he has been
tricked. You can bring the Khan’s ambassador to my place and live with me, to
avoid Fo Er the opportunity to attack.”</p><p>Qiao Xian acknowledged
it.</p><p>Originally she thought
that Cui Buqu would immediately arrange a meeting with Khan Apa’s ambassador,
but who knew that he was more interested in the matter concerning the Lu manor.</p><p>“What happened to Lady
Lu? Tell me.” Cui Buqu said.</p><p>Qiao Xian, “This is a
long story.</p><p>Lu Ti only has one
daughter, so naturally she was well-loved and seen as an invaluable pearl. He
could not help but want to give her all the good things in the world, so when
the time came when she was of age to be wed, Lu Ti was also slightly unwilling.
He wanted her to be older before arranging a marriage for her, so he could give
the Lu business to his son-in-law.</p><p>Lady Lu has a cousin
brother, who is the one that bickered with Feng Xiao a few days ago in the “Five
Tastes” restaurant, Su Xing. Su Xing’s parents were both dead and he was a ward
of the Lu family. His age was incredibly close to Lady Lu, and he was quite
handsome, so they both fell in love. Although Lu Ti thought Su Xing did not
have a good life, since both his parents are dead, but his daughter loved him,
and Su Xing did not have any family members to object, he was ideal to marry
into the Lu family and become one of them. Originally, he wanted to wait for
another two more years to arrange a marriage for them.</p><p>A while ago, because of
business issues, Lu Ti was reunited with his distant relative in Fanyang Lu
Sect. As they exchanged letters, the other party has an elder that liked Lady
Lu and wanted to arrange a marriage for her with a young man from his family
who was related to the Taiyuan royal family.</p><p>Lu Ti acknowledged that
the young man was only one to two years older than Lady Lu and he excelled in academics,
his father was also s subject of the Imperial Court, so he would definitely
have a bright future, in fact, his future had endless potential.</p><p>Towards such a good
candidate, he was obviously a hundred times better than Su Xing. It was
difficult for Lu Ti to not be moved, so once Lady Lu heard about it, although
she had always been obedient and gentle, she had a fight with her father that
night. After they fought, that unfortunate incident happened to her.</p><p>It also means that, that
night, was the same night that the House of Blades were pursuing that
mysterious person from the Qiushan manor and saw him leap into the Lu manor.
After that, something happened to Lady Lu.</p><p><b>Author’s Notes:</b></p><p>Alright, Little Cui’s
second layer is about to be shed.</p><p>Cui Buqu: That is fine. I
still have many more layers. I’m not afraid that I will not be exposed, only
that you are being too soft.</p><p>Feng Xiao: ……</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>No matter how people cui you, you just refuse to go:
</b>While ‘Cui’ means nothing as a
surname, as a word itself, it means ‘urging or pestering [someone] to go
[somewhere]’ and ‘Buqu’ means ‘refuse to go’. This is not a really a usual name
anyone would have, and it definitely does not sound like a real Chinese name.
That is why Feng Xiao suspected it’s an alias.</p><p><b>Qiemo City: </b>This is the same city that they passed by in the first few chapters
when they were travelling to the City of Six Crafts.</p><p><b>In the past, they used to enjoy drawing eyebrows</b>: It’s a saying that originated from a myth that
ancient Chinese husbands enjoyed drawing the eyebrows for their wives. It is a
seen as a romantic activity between husband and wife. Feng Xiao simply thinks
that face painting and drawing eyebrows are similar, and thus what he did to
Cui Buqu’s face.</p>

<p><b>Translator's Notes:</b> I have two things to announce. The first is, 
a Spanish translation is now available! Please check out <a href="index.html">News and Updates</a>.</p>
<p> The second thing is that I notice we are 8 chapters to ending the first arc. For those who has 
seen some spoilers, it also means we will be meeting Mrs Cui quite soon! :) </p>
