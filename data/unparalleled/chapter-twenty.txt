</p><h2>Chapter 20 – He Came To Kill Feng Xiao</h2><br><br>

<p>The
man in grey swore that he’d had never done anything to the jade, and definitely
did not intentionally destroy it.</p><p>But
as to why the jade turned to dust in his hands, he really had no explanation
behind it.</p><p>The
other two suddenly got in sync, surrounding him, killing off any path he could
run away from.</p><p>Bing
Xuan smiled, “Sir, you have such a temper. If you cannot obtain it, you have
decided to destroy it, so others could not have it as well.”</p><p>The
man in the bamboo hat said nothing, but his body language was obvious enough
that he would not let the man in grey get away easily.</p><p>“I
did not do anything to it. It crumbled to dust on its own.” The man in grey
said coldly.</p><p>“We
are two people with four eyes and we have saw it ourselves, could there have
any misunderstanding?” Bing Xuan twitched her brows.</p><p>Cui
Buqu leaned against the door and coughed in a low voice. Just now when the grey
man took his first move, he immediately knew who he was. However, it was not
wise show-off at this moment of time. His body was riddled with illness, and
everyone present did not thought of him as a threat. He would not do anything
that might put himself in danger.</p><p>Additionally,
he might not be the only one among these people who saw who he was.</p><p>As
he expected, the man with the bamboo hat said suddenly. “Your sword style
heavily resembled the katana technique, passed down by the <b>Japanese</b> people to the Suwo Sect, yet it is also modified in a way.
I heard that Goguryeo welcomed a new martial artist after Gao Ning. The martial
artist claimed to have a Japanese as his tutor, and is innovative. If I am not
wrong, you are him.”</p><p>The
way he spoke was alluring, almost gentle. If this was any usual day, it would
surely make one feel as if the spring wind had just washed over them. However,
with the situation now, it was impossible to imagine it that way.</p><p>Bing
Xuan could not help but glared at the man in white.</p><p>She
felt that since the other man could tell the background of the man in grey at
the blink of an eye, he was definitely not a nobody. However, when she pondered
over it, she could not figure out who among the famed Jianghu figures could
have been him.</p><p>Unless
he isn’t from Jianghu?</p><p>Bing
Xuan twitched her eyebrow. Although she came for the jade tonight, she did not
have the intention of taking it. Because she knew that the House of Blades is
no easy push over, so she could not have took it with ease.</p><p>Needless
to say, there were so many skilled martial artists here today. Alone that Turk
is already a handful.</p><p>As
she thought, Bing Xuan smiled and combed the strands of her hair that had fell
loose.</p><p>“Lord
Feng, there are too many honoured guest at your place. I wager you would not
have time to entertain me, so this is goodbye. I will come another day.”</p><p>Without
waiting for Feng Xiao to respond, she kicked herself into the air, as light as
a feather, and leaped onto the roof, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>The
Turk that was branded by Bing Xuan as her number one enemy, at this moment, was
taken by surprise. </p><p>The
reason is none other than Feng Xiao’s looks did not match his combat abilities.
Because he looked handsomely pretty and delicate on the outside, when he fought
it caused one to be even more shocking. </p><p>(<b>Translator’s notes:</b> Can someone please
count how many people thus far has called Feng Xiao pretty in their heads?)</p><p>The
Turk had never stepped into the Central Plains before, yet he came here
carrying a good amount of confidence. For even if he demonstrated his skills in
the Wulin of the Central Plains, there are very few who could match his skills.
He was enough to be surpass an entire generations of top martial artists.</p><p>This
was until he met Feng Xiao.</p><p>Feng
Xiao’s moves were not bombastic like Fo Er, but it was swift and light,
fluttering of wide sleeves, extending like a blanket of snow. From the side
lines, he looked like a flower that was smiling. Every move drew an imagery of beautiful
aesthetic from the heart.</p><p>However
to this Turkish man, in these aesthetically beautiful views, none of them weren’t
hiding an intention to kill. Every move of his was light, but everyone held a
trap.</p><p>He
had already recoiled his initial moves that were slow and light, taking his
current opponent now seriously. Even if the jade has crumbled into dust, it was
unable to distract him.</p><p>As
two master of the martial arts faced-off, this was indeed a rare sight to see.
Even the man in white and the Goguryeoian stopped to watch them.</p><p>Cui
Buqu coughed twice and said in a low voice, “This man didn’t come for the jade.
He came to kill Feng Xiao.”</p><p>These
words, naturally, was meant for Pei Jingzhe.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was taken by surprise, “Why do you say that?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu laughed, “Did you not notice? From the moment he appeared, he only looked
at Feng Xiao, he did not even spare a glance at the jade, and he did not
participate in the fight for it.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “Do you know who he is?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I have never seen him in my life, but if I was not wrong, this man is Fo
Er, the number one martial artist under Khan Ishbara’s banner. He was the
disciple of a great master and gathered the pros of all techniques. Since he
stepped into the Central Plains, he had never lost a fight, so he was
proclaimed a master of his generation.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe took in a breath of fresh air. He had never thought that a quiet night
such as this would attract such a martial artist.</p><p>“Between
him and my Lord, who is stronger?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I don’t even know how to fight, and you are asking me?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>He
observed for a while, but realized that those two few into the air, their
shadows were impossible to see, because their speed was too fast. Even Pei
Jingzhe could not see who was currently at an advantage.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt a little nervous and turned around to rush back into the manor.</p><p>After
a short while, he carried something heavy and ran out, shouting towards Feng
Xiao, “My Lord, your zither!”</p><p>“Bring
it.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao’s voice came, clear like the wind, without any hint of unsteadiness or
anxiousness. Pei Jingzhe’s eyes shone brightly as he tossed the thing in his
hand into the air.</p><p>A
sound could only be heard, like the sound of a golden mount, like the sound of
a hundred thousand soldiers were killed. It made one feel as though the hairs
on their hands were standing in a cold, eerie feeling.</p><p>The
men of Jianghu held many weapons, some had knives and some had guns, but this
was the first time Fo Er saw someone using a zither as a weapon. The zither
that looked ashen and heavy, but Feng Xiao managed to make it look as if it was
weightless, like the gentle toy of a child. It can be used for offensive
measured, as well as defensive measured, leaving one unable to predict his
moves.</p><p>“A
good zither!” The man in white could not help himself but shouted.</p><p>But
Gao Ning was not as free as the other. His eyebrows tightens and turned away
from Feng Xiao and Fo Er’s battle, instead, he turned his attention towards Pei
Jingzhe and Cui Buqu.</p><p>In
the blink of an eye, he lunged himself towards Pei Jingzhe and Cui Buqu, knife
as sharp as the breath of the sea, sweeping towards both of them. As Pei
Jingzhe pulled Cui Buqu to step backwards, he suddenly changed his moves, using
one hand like claws, he reached out to Pei Jingzhe.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe originally though that he was after Cui Buqu, intending to make him a
hostage, so he pushed Cui Buqu away and drew his sword to face off with the
enemy. Who knew that Gao Ning was never interested in Cui Buqu, instead, he had
been after Pei Jingzhe all along. As the sword fell onto Pei Jingzhe, he could
feel only a numbing pain, his sword almost falling out of his grasp. Gao Ning
held on to him, posing his knife on the side of his neck.</p><p>“Surrender
the jade, or I’ll kill you!” Gao Ning said in a low voice.</p><p>“The
jade was destroyed by you just now!” Pei Jingzhe said angrily.</p><p>Gao
Ning laughed, “Spare your breathe, that was obviously a fake!”</p><p>He
then turned towards Feng Xiao, “If that jade was authentic, how would you
people give it out so easily. If you refuse to bring out the real jade, then I
will kill him here and now!”</p><p>Although
he was now between life and death, Pei Jingzhe still could not help asking, “Why
did you choose me?”</p><p>On
normal situations, why wasn’t he asked the Cui Buqu, who did not possess any
fighting skills?</p><p>Gao
Ning said coldly, “Do not even try to fool me. As Feng Xiao’s lover and one who
travels with him throughout Jianghu, he is sure to carry some secret techniques
on him. You, on the other hand, is dispensable and your skills are mediocre. If
not you, then who?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “???”</p><p>Currently,
Gao Ning’s words did serious damage to his pride. &nbsp;But what hurt him most was Feng Xiao’s voice
that came floating from above. </p><p>“Since
you know that he is indispensable, why did you take him? Why not take my lover,
perhaps I will feel threatened!” </p><p>As
the voice dissipated, the man in white laughed, “Is that so? Let me try.”</p><p>Then
he moved and immediately went to Cui Buqu’s side.</p><p>Cui
Buqu felt a sharp pain, and found himself unable to move.</p><p></p><p><b>Japanese: </b>I am not completely sure if this is accurate. The
