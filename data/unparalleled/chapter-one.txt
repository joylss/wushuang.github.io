<br><h2>Chapter 1  - Of Fine Jade and Pristine White</h2><br><br>
<p>The northern
wind bellows, and spring breeze grows unrest.</p><p>In these recent
three months, the frontier pass remains quiet.</p><p>The colour of
the sky still retained some degree of the colour blue, yet as one blinks, it
changes abruptly. Dark clouds gathered above heads in a dense energy and formed
an imagery that was nigh impossible for its watchers to look away.</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
could feel the speed of the travelling company gradually slowing down. He could
not help but part the curtains to extend his neck outside to take a look.</p><p>As the wind
enters through, bringing grains of sand, his concubine lets out a gasp and
wraps her arms around his shoulder.</p><p>“My Lord, would
we be able to reach the city before nightfall?”</p><p>Jiao Meiwan’s
voice soothe the worry in Yuchi Jinwu’s heart. He patted his concubine on her
thigh, feeling her soft skin beneath those thin robes. One can imagine tearing
away that annoying fabric and touch that smooth, bare skin. However, currently
he has no desire to flirt with his beloved concubine.</p><p>“I suppose we
can,” Yuchi Jinwu answered uncertainly, wrinkles appearing on his forehead.</p><p>He is of the
royal family of the Kingdom of Khotan. Acting upon orders of the Khotan King,
he came forth to the Central Plain to offer tribute to its king.</p><p>At this moment,
the Sui had just taken over and established their rule, becoming the new
reigning power of the Northern Dynasty.</p><p>Emperor Yang
Jian’s ambitious and intriguing efforts made the vitality of this new dynasty,
just like the infinite brilliance of the rising sun, and even the southern Chen
Dynasty also sent forth an ambassador to congratulate them.</p><p>Although Khotan
is situated in the countryside, posing only as a small kingdom, they were often
harassed by the Turks. When the King of Khotan heard tidings of the Sui Dynasty
succeeding as the new government, he did not hesitate to grab this chance to
send forth Yuchi Jinwu as an ambassador with a hefty gift to Xingcheng to meet
the Sui King. For one, to cultivate a good relationship, and secondly, to
implore the Sui Dynasty to send out troops to protect Khotan.</p><p>Who could’ve
known that this trip had been so unfortunate.</p><p>When they left
Khotan, his group fell ill all of a sudden. It took them a good few days to
recover before embarking on the journey again. Then, they got caught up in
terrible weather such as this; Yuchi Jinwu felt irritated and tired. He wanted
so badly to put on a pair of wings and just fly to Xingcheng immediately.</p><p>He could not
help but glare at the corner of the carriage.</p><p>There were two
chests there that were used to store Yuchi Jinwu’s belongings. Because the
carriage was quite spacious and the chests weren’t large, Yuchi Jinwu purposely
ordered the servants to bring them into his carriage so that it needn’t be
placed at the back.</p><p>This action was
noticed by his concubine; the latter giggled, “My Lord, could it be that you’ve
hidden a beautiful woman in that chest?”</p><p>Her words
lifted the anxiety in Yuchi Jinwu’s heart. “If it really is a beautiful woman,
then, what would you do?”</p><p>Jiao Meiwan
huffed in annoyance, “Then I would have no choice but to share you!”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu laughed
and took her into his arms. They were both extremely close to each other,
flirting here and there. Yuchi Jinwu could feel his worries had dissipated. </p><p>“If I told you,
promise me that you won’t tell anyone. At the very least, before we arrive in
Xingcheng, do not breathe it to another soul.”</p><p>The more
secretive he was, the more his concubine grew curious, pulling at his sleeves.</p><p>Then only did
Yuchi Jinwu say softly, “In that chest, there is a tribute.”</p><p>She asked,
“Aren’t tributes usually placed inside the last carriage?”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu,
“Those are only for ordinary tributes. With only merely ordinary gold and
silver treasuries, how would theyy ever hope of gaining attention from the Sui
Emperor?”</p><p>Jiao Meiwan,
“We are only a small kingdom. What treasuries would we have that would make
even the Sui King unable to resist? Unless it’s some sort of rare jade?”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
pinched her cheek, “Smart. It is related to jade, but it’s not just any jade,
it is the <b>Tianchi Yudan</b>.”</p><p>Jiao Meiwan
squealed, “That legendary jade that can make one immortal?!”</p><p>Before she
could finish, Yuchi had already covered her mouth. She acted quickly upon
seeing the serious glare in his eyes and apologized, “I forget my manners, I am
sorry. This is one of the Kingdom of Khotan’s treasure. How could his Majesty
bear to give it away?”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
responded, “So what if he could not bear to give it away? If he wants an
alliance with the Sui King, he needs to present something of worth; only then
will it be regarded as showing the utmost sincerity.”</p><p>Although the
Tianchi Yudan contains the word ‘Tianchi’, it had nothing to do with heaven. It
was unintentionally discovered by a woodcutter of Khotan who mistakenly entered
the cave, so he discovered that unusual piece of jade stone. According to the
legends, it was as clear as morning dew with a pool of azure blue in its
centre, similar to Heaven’s Lake that was surrounded by snow, hence its name.</p><p>The woodcutter
presented it before the Khotan King, at that time, whose mother was diagnosed
with a strange illness and was unable to recover. However, after she was
treated with medicine made from a shard of the jade, not only did she fully
recover, but it was as if her body was wrought anew. This king’s mother then
lived until she was over ninety years old and had just only passed recently.</p><p>Because of
this, the Tianchi Yudan’s fame spread across the lands and in the eyes of many;
it doesn’t only return one’s youth but can also cure any strange disease in
existence and was extremely powerful for people who were trained in the martial
arts. A treasure such as this was coveted by many, but the Khotan King treated
it like a national treasure and no one knew where he had hidden the Tianchi
Yudan. The Turks also kept their eyes closely on Khotan, perhaps hoping to take
the Tianchi Yudan for themselves one day.</p><p>However, the
Khotan King was no fool. He understood the value of the jade, but compared to
the destruction of his kingdom and family, the jade meant nothing. He was
willing to give it away if it meant protection for his people. At the very
least, it was better than allowing it to fall into the hands of the Turks.</p><p>The concubine
listened as he thought and said, “But My Lord, with such a valuable treasure
like this, there are only a few people guarding it. Does the Khotan King think
this is fine?”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
smiled, “Don’t underestimate those outside. Those are his Majesty’s most
skilled bodyguards. Practically all of them were assigned to this voyage. It’s
the fact that they don’t look like it that’s important.”</p><p>As he thought,
he reminded her again, “Only you and I know of this matter. Do not repeat this
to a third person.”</p><p>The concubine
nodded her head. “I know the consequences of this. If the information leaked,
then we would definitely be in trouble. So the less people know, the better.”</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
played with her hair, satisfied. “During these 4 to 5 years that you were with
me, I knew you were the most understanding one. But you needn’t worry too much.
When we enter the city, the Sui King will send men forwards to protect us. When
that time comes, we no longer need to worry.”</p><p>As they both
spoke, the wind grew stronger and stronger. The horse carriages shook, creating
an uneasy sound.</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu
lost all his interest in conversing and, instead, bit on his lip and stopped
talking.</p><p>His concubine
held his robes tightly, too afraid to even move.</p><p>Among the sound of violent winds, Yuchi Jinwu heard a
wave of noises that sounded like horse hooves.&nbsp;</p><p>In these wretched whether, whoever the traveller is, they
would definitely would not be merchants. This could only mean that it was the
soldiers sent by the Sui King.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu shook his head and turned towards his
concubine. "Let me go out and take a look... "</p><p>The curtains were withdrawn suddenly, a bodyguard peeks
in from the outside and said quickly, "My Lord, the windstorm is too
hectic. Let us move forward to take shelter—"</p><p>Then everything happened all at once.&nbsp;</p><p>From the way Yuchi Jinwu felt irritated at being
interrupted by the bodyguard to the shock wide in his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>He could only stare at the blood spluttering as the
bodyguard's head flew into the air, hitting the roof of the carriage before
falling heavily to the ground, rolling in circles on the white mat on the
ground and finally rolling to the side of his foot.&nbsp;</p><p>From the side of his ear, Jiao Meiwan screamed, but her
voice sounded far away. He felt a cloth slip over his ears so he couldn't hear
anything but muffled sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>A cold feeling washed over him and he tensed. His heart
had long told him to shy away, but his body could not react in time. From his chest,
a sharp pain spread as something pierced his chest and ribcage.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuchi Jinwu's vision was soon coloured with different
shades of red.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, for one to be alive in one second and be dead
in the next only took such a brief time.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what he thought of when he collapsed to the
ground.&nbsp;</p><p>…..</p><p>Snow particles flew in the air, enough to cover up for
all the stains in the world.</p><p>Yet covering up was only temporarily. Once the cloud
disperse and the snow melted, those stains would resurface once more.</p><p>Dried blood
blackened, mixing among the blocks of snow. From afar, they looked as if they
were stones merely covered in gathered snow.</p><p>Among all the
dead horses that laid on the ground, there were also overturned carriages and a
few severed heads buried in the snow. From the sight of it, one could tell that
it had been some time already since that the incident had happened.</p><p>From the
distance, the sound of horse hooves sounded as it got closer.</p><p>A few dozen men
approached from the snow, horses kicking up snow as they trotted forwards.
Breathes formed puffs of smoke in the air. </p><p>Among them,
their leader wore a black coat, practically covered up to his neck. The only
sound he exuded was when the wind picked up, his coat bellowed beneath the
wind.</p><p>Behind him,
dozens of men followed tightly, their coats buttoned up to the neck in a
similar fashion. No one was willing to expose their skin to such a horrendous
weather. </p><p>They looked as
if they’d expected such a gruesome scene. Their faces showed no signs of shock
or disgust. Instead, they acted quickly, dismounting their horses to move
forward to take a look.</p><p>One corpse laid
sprawled on the ground, practically covered by the snow, exposing only a
shoulder and neck as white as snow. A wound stretches across his throat to the
back of his neck. From this point of view, it could be seen how deep the wound
was. His neck was practically snapped in two, demonstrating the strength of his
murderer.</p><p>A hand reached
out from under a black coat.</p><p>That hand is
fair and slender and so pale that it looked almost as if the skin was a sheet
of glass over white bones like fine white jade. It was not necessarily to
flaunt any stylish moves and already, people would have stopped and stare. A
pair of hands like this are not hands that commoners would have. </p><p>But the owner
of these hands did not feel disgusted by the blood stains. He took a handful of
snow tainted with blood with his fingers, before releasing them and watch the
snow particles fall.</p><p>The man lowered
his head, eyebrow gradually raising.</p><p>The guard on
duty by his side was sighing over missing the chance to bribe this important
guest who came from the capital. Watching the scene, he quickly took out a
clean cloth and mustered a smile on his face.</p><p>“Sir, I have a
clean cloth here, you—”</p><p>Before he would
finish talking, his speaking adversary shed his coat and tossed it behind him!</p><p>The guard
watched with his mouth agape when the man’s coat was caught by some young man.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
smiled bitterly. “My Lord...” </p><p>“Hold on to it,”
said the man flatly.</p><p>Without the
coat, he was practically exposed to the harsh windstorm, clad in fine jade and
pristine white, the tails of his robes fluttering in the wind.</p><p>The men who
came with him watched the scene as they trembled, while he alone remained
unfazed and unmoved. He bent his waist and head and continued to inspect the
corpse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Tianchi Yudan: </b>literally means ‘Jade from the Lake of Heaven.”</p>
