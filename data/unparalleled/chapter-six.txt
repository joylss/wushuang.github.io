<br><h2>Chapter 6 – Does This Name Sound Nice?</h2><br><br>
<p>The Linlang
Alliance’s branches were spread in prevalent across Nanbei. Every year, an
auction only made their business more eventful. Although Linlang Alliance
executed the auction in different locations every year—sometimes in Jiangnan,
sometimes in Haibei, and today they’re doing it in the City of Six Crafts—but
regardless of the wealthy, the rich, or commoners and scums. People from every
corner of the world would come to participate.</p><p>Watchers would
not be able to understand what was going on, they would only understand that
there were a lot of valuable treasures being sold. The truth is, however, while
there were a lot of expensive treasures, there were also goods such as medicine
that were difficult to purchase on the market and manuscripts that were long
lost to history, and spices that came from Western Regions. For those who did
not want to travel to all corners of the country to purchase them, the auction
is a fabulous marketplace, therefore, it received many welcomes.</p><p>Due to Lanling
Alliance’s rich and powerful background, those from the pugilist world dare not
offend them. There were little squabbles here and there, but nothing too
serious. Every year, the auction well really well.</p><p>This year is an
exception.</p><p>When Lanling
Alliance decided to make the City of the Six Crafts their auction place,
everyone swelled in anticipation. Because The City of Six Crafts is no rich nor
wealthy place, and it not a big or famous city like Xingcheng. Although it is a
city that many travellers will pass by no matter where they were heading, this
is also a place near to the Turks. It is far from any capitals and did not have
many people. The rich and wealthy did not liked coming here, so the
participants of this year was a lot lesser than the last. Most of them were
pugilists and merchants from Nanbei.</p><p>The incident
happened outside the branch they established in the City of Six Crafts. One man
just walked out, and then, among the group of peasants who simply passed by,
someone flew out of the group with a sword, intending to stab him. The two men
fought, in the end, the attacker bled to death. At this moment, a woman came
out and lunged herself at the man, crying out loudly that he had killed her
brother.</p><p>Under the
public eyes, the murderer and the one who is murdered were both surrounded by
the crowd and unable to leave. The police bureau ruches here quickly and found
the murderer’s identity to be tedious, so they quickly called for Country
Magistrate Zhao, who begged for Feng Xiao to come.</p><p>When Feng Xiao arrived,
the body has yet to be taken away. The young lady was crying next to him.
Seeing two black shadow moving closer, she stopped crying, but did not raise
her head. Her eyes were brimmed with tears as she remained silent.</p><p>But Feng Xiao
paid her no attention, instead, his gaze moved away from her to the murderer.</p><p>“Is it you who
killed this man?”</p><p>The young man
looked shocked and surprised, naturally, he responded in a darkly manner to
Feng Xiao’s question, yet he could not act much as many people are watching.</p><p>County
Magistrate Zhao saw the situation and quickly said, “This My Lord Feng is from
the capital Beijing by the orders of—“ </p><p>He looked at
Feng Xiao once. At first, he wanted to name the House of Blades, but he wasn’t
certain if Feng Xiao wanted his identity revealed, so he changed his words
quickly and said instead, “by the orders to investigate the murder of the
Khotan ambassador. He came here to help.”</p><p>He turns to
Feng Xiao and introduced both parties, “This is the chairman of the Linlang
Alliance Wen Liang. The deceased is Ying Wuqiu. The other is his sister.”</p><p>Wen Liang took
a step forward and said, “I am Wen Liang, you two better know that just now, I
was exiting this building with my underlings and that man came out of nowhere
as he schemed to take me out. Thank god, I am skilled in the martial arts and
could avoid it and was not injured. However, he died on the spot, but I was not
the one who killed him.”</p><p>The woman said
in anger, “Under broad daylight, everyone saw it! You fought with my brother
and my brother by murdered after you hit him a few times. A life for a life,
what do you have to say!”</p><p>Compared to the
young woman’s temper, Wen Liang looked very calm. “This man schemes against me
first, I am only defending myself. The few hits I’ve landed on was were all
non-fatal. Once examined, the truth will be clear.”</p><p>The young
woman, “If it wasn’t for you who murdered our father, how would brother be so
apathetic about his own life and came to kill you!?”</p><p>Wen Liang
smiled, “Do not frame others. When have I murdered your father? You got the
wrong person, from the beginning, everything was a joke!”</p><p>The young woman
glared at him, holding hatred in her heart, “Wen Liang, even if you turned to
ash, I still would’ve been able to recognize you!”</p><p>It is obvious
this case is complicated. Feng Xiao happened to be the judge, so he made a
gesture and a few men came forward to being related witnesses back to be
questioned.</p><p>The young lady
refused to leave, but had no choice when she was held on the left and right arm.
She could only look back at Wen Liang with reddened eyes. For one to describe
it, if there is indeed vengeful ghosts in this world, she would have ran
against a pillar and kill herself, then turn into a vengeful ghost, coming back
to take revenge on Wen Liang.</p><p>Yet Wen Liang
did not look at her, but approached Feng Xiao and bowed. “My Lord Feng, may we
speak for a moment?”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Speak.”</p><p>Wen Liang said
cheekily, “These few years the Linlang Alliance have been fairing well, there
are bound to have people who are envious. I succeeded my parents and became the
chairman, perhaps this is the reason so many troubles were drawn to me, so
please, I implore My Lord Feng and County Magistrate Zhao to investigate to the
very end.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“This matter happened in the City of the Six Crafts. Its magistrate will take
care of the matter. You may relay this to him, no need to tell me.”</p><p>The corpse have
been taken away, at this moment, leaving a trail of blood on the ground, its
shade of crimson turning darker as the seconds ticked by.</p><p>Feng Xiao
stared at the ground, and felt a sudden wind against his ears. As someone who
practiced the martial arts, his reflexes were naturally quick and accurate. A
needle flew past his body and flew towards Wen Liang who is just a few steps
away from him!</p><p>Wen Liang
hadn’t managed to react quickly enough, and his skills might only be just
moderately fine, so he could not avoid such manner of sneak attack.</p><p>Feng Xiao
rolled his sleeve, and after a moment, he cast the needle to the ground.</p><p>Wen Liang only
saw Feng Xiao making a move and even thought that he wanted to hit him, so he
took a few steps back, “You!”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“There is a needle on the ground.”</p><p>Wen Liang
gathered himself and looked on the ground, and saw indeed there was a needle
there. There were bluish substance on the needle, perhaps it was coated with
poisoned. He raised his head and watch Feng Xiao staring at him with a
judgemental look.</p><p>“I have no idea
who hates me so much and wanted me dead!” Wen Liang laughed bitterly.</p><p>Feng Xiao told
County Magistrate Zhao, “You may take him back to the bureau first and allow me
to question him personally.”</p><p>Wen Liang, “I
am no criminal……”</p><p>Feng Xiao
interrupted his words, “Anyone who is related to the case, be it innocent or
guilty, all suspicious people will be questioned by my first before any
judgements are made.”</p><p>Wen Liang, “But
I have to be here for the auction tomorrow!”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Aside you, is there no one else? If that is so, Linlang Alliance should just
shut down!”</p><p>His words were
unreasonable, yet it allowed no argument. Wen Liang looked shocked and wanted
to say something, but Feng Xiao’s men were already holding him down, he laughed
coldly and spoke, “What’s so great about Beijing? If I refuse to allow you to
take me, what can you do?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
turned around and stared at him, the light shone in the lines of his face, both
eyes as sharp as claws, enough to pin a man to the ground. “From which corner
of the wall did you merge from?”</p><p>Now only did he
notice the other man had turned from calm and impassive to irritated and angry
that his nose seemed to have become crooked.</p><p>“I am from the
house of the Princess Leping, do not tell me you have not even heard of the
princess! If you have the balls, go to the court and offer your name and place.
When I return to Beijing and ask for the princess’ favour, the emperor will
definitely help me!”</p><p>People from the
princess’ house would mean that they were simply her servants. When one wants
to punish a dog, they must also regard the identity of their master. If their
master is just any ordinary person, that is fine, but this is the Princess
Leping, she is not only the eldest daughter of the emperor, Yang Lihua, but she
is also the former dynasty’s empress and empress dowager. As Yang Jian changed
the dynasty, declaring Sui for its name, he took the country from his
daughter’s husband and remade the former queen a princess.</p><p>Yang Huali was
a strict and proper person and disapproved of her father’s actions. However,
she is only one woman on her own so there was nothing she could do. Yang Jian
and his wife wanted to make up for their daughter, so they treasured, loved,
and tolerated her even more, even more so than a few of their other sons.
Anything Princess Leping requested, as long as it is not treason, the Emperor
and Empress would not refuse her. Using the princess’ identity sometimes is
even more effective than naming any officials in court.</p><p>Princess Leping
took some dividend from the Linlang Alliance, naturally, she became their
shield. Anyone who wanted to threaten Linlang Alliance, when they heard of the
princess, they would quickly retreat. Other than that, the Linlang Alliance
also had some other supports at their backs.</p><p>But when Feng
Xiao heard the words ‘Princess Leping’ from the other man, not only did he
refuse to grant what he wanted, but the colour on his face had even darkened.
His eyebrow twitched, and he forced a smile, “I am Feng Xiao, I hail from the
House of Blades. Is this name music to the ears?”</p><p>

The servants from the princess’ house grew
deathly pale when they heard Feng Xiao’s name. Just now, they were prideful and
stuck up, now they look like they’ve just seen a ghost, feeling like a thousand
needles were pricking their foot. All they wanted to do at that moment was
sprout some wings and fly away.
