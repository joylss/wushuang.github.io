<h2>Chapter 27 – Dad~~ Dad~~</h2><br><br>

<p>Whether
dignity or pride was more important, perhaps there are some people who would
rather live a punishing life to keep their dignity, but these are definitely
not the ways of Feng Xiao, so he ultimately chose the latter.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Dad……”</p><p>His
voice was very soft with barely any strength, it was brought by the light wind
up to Cui Buqu’s ears, like someone listening to faint music.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I cannot hear it properly.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Pull me up first, I have no strength left.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu laughed coldly, “’I have no strength’ are so many words strung altogether,
yet you couldn’t even say ‘Dad’?”</p><p>Just
now, Tang Li massaged his shoulders for him, so right now, Cui Buqu felt that
both his shoulders have already regained their strength. Feng Xiao seemed like
he was also stepping on a slope of stone down below, for if not, Cui Buqu might
not be able to even pull him up.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Dad~~~Dad~~~~”</p><p>These
two ‘dads’ the first one was pitched, but the second one’s tone was low.
However, this wasn’t because Feng Xiao’s voice was covered by the snow and storms.
It’s carried by a tone that sounded really wronged.</p><p>If
it had been a weak maiden screaming like that, one would have felt pity for
her, but with how Feng Xiao <b>pinched his
nose</b> and shouted in a high pitched voice, it would only make one’s skin
crawl, in fact, enough to make them lose all their strength and fall right
down.</p><p>As if he had expected this to happen, Feng Xiao
held his hand and suddenly pull him down with a huge amount of strength. Cui
Buqu fell down immediately, being dragged down all the way. At the same time, a
huge wind blew his way and sand whirled in the wind, entering his eyes. He
could not even grab onto the stone, and just like that, he was pulled down by
Feng Xiao.</p><p>But there are a lot of things that are
difficult to predict in this world, for example, he would never expect that
Feng Xiao was unable to hold on.</p><p>Feng Xiao knew martial arts, so he might not
die if he fell, but from that amount of height, to a normal person like Cui Buqu,
it would have definitely claim his life. That moment when he was pulled down,
Cui Buqu practically owned up to fate.</p><p>But very quickly he discovered that Feng Xiao
wasn’t falling down, in fact, his foot very quickly reached the ground, pulling
him into a cave.</p><p> Both of
their breaths were ragged and blinking in the dark. Outside, the storms and
winds grew stronger, covering any last traces of light.</p><p>Following the sound of the winds outside, Cui
Buqu inhales, “So you……”</p><p>Just as he said three words, his mouth was
immediately silenced. Feng Xiao’s body pressed close, pressing him against the
cave until he could not even move.</p><p>The cave existed midway down the
cliff. Judging from the way it looked, it was created from the winds that
bellowed here for a while now. The cave was narrow on the inside, so when both
of them squeezed together, it was even tighter.</p><p>However, Cui Buqu knew that Feng
Xiao doing such a pointless actions was not solely to pull his leg, so he did
not move and did not struggle against him.</p><p>As expected, after a while, a black
shadow moved outside.</p><p>Cui Buqu’s eyes were sharp, he
recognized that it was one of the assassins that went down to look for Feng
Xiao just now.</p><p>From Feng Xiao’s current situation,
he might not win in a fight of one against two. If they were still lingering
above the cliff like just now, they would already have been discovered by now.</p><p>The shadow suddenly stopped, both
legs stepping on a stone that stuck out outside, looking around downwards.</p><p>The cave was both small and pitch black,
it was impossible to see anything at all.</p><p>There was no need for Feng Xiao to
point it out, Cui Buqu was already long unmoving, the only thing moving was his
beating heart.</p><p>The man furrowed his eyebrows for a
while, as if he was contemplating whether or not to continue searching. Cui
Buqu felt Feng Xiao’s body moved slightly. He only heard a very soft sound of
something brushing against the rock, as if something above their head exploded,
immediately he looked outside.</p><p>The assassin was startled. He did
not expect such a large bat to fly out of the cave. He reached out a palm to
slap it, but it only drew more bats flying towards him, leaving little claw
marks on his face. He lost his balance and fell down.</p><p>Cui Buqu could not have guessed
that there were bats hibernating in the cave. Another wave of bats flew down
from above their heads and he felt that this wasn’t any less threatening than
facing death itself. Needless to say for Feng Xiao who loved cleanliness like
gold, who just took a shower not long ago. He estimate that when Feng Xiao
return home, he would definitely shred off one layer of skin and felt his heart
jumping in glee at the thought. Even if he was in danger right now, he felt
that it wasn’t so bad.</p><p> Feng Xiao finally removed his hand from his
face.</p><p>But before Cui Buqu could release a
breath of air, he heard the other man say, “There is still one more.”</p><p>Before he finished his words, a
shadow flew in from the outside in a fierce force, swords gleaming in hand,
aiming directly at Feng Xiao!</p><p>Feng Xiao’s zither was long gone,
he rose from his position and attacked with a palm towards the opponent,
turning his body sideways slightly when the tip of the sword almost touched his
shoulder, allowing the sword to slice open his clothes and the surface of his
skin slightly as his palm hit the assassin’s neck square.</p><p>As Cui Buqu listened, he heard the
breaking of bones, and that man simply flew out of the cave.</p><p>“Go?” Cui Buqu said.</p><p>Naturally, now is the best time to
return. Fo Er and Gao Ning were long gone and chances of them returning were
slim. Of the two Yunhai Thirteen Stories assassins, one was killed by Feng
Xiao, and the other fell down the cliff, probably half-dead by now. Even if he
wasn’t dead, he’s probably unconscious.</p><p>“I can no longer move.” Feng Xiao
breathed quietly.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “This cave is not far
from the surface. I can go up, and bring help.”</p><p>Feng Xiao answered with an ‘Oh’,
“Then go.”</p><p>Cui Buqu twitched his lips, “……then
let me go.”</p><p>But the other man still held
tightly to his wrist.</p><p>Feng Xiao answered innocently, “I
want to let go, but my hand refuses to listen to me, there is nothing I can
go.”</p><p>This man was obviously worried that
once Cui Buqu left, he would never return. Even if Pei Jingzhe found him, it
would already be the next morning. The night is long, still, and there are a
lot of things that could happen.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “We can work together.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Speak.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I know something related
to the case you are investigating now, it may help you gain a breakthrough. I
can tell you what it is.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Then why did you not
say earlier?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I too just only knew
about it.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “I should have guessed
you were plotting something and pulling strings behind my back.”</p><p>Cui Buqu did not bulge an inch, “Do
you want to know or not?”</p><p>Feng Xiao knew they would remain
here for a little while, so he relaxes, allowing himself to completely forget
the situation he is in at the moment and leaned against the rocky walls. Only,
he refused to let go of Cui Buqu’s hand, “Why should I trust you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Did you not guess my
identity earlier?”</p><p>Feng Xiao raised his voice a
little, “Oh? Finally admitting it now, are you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “That is correct. The Zuoyue
Bureau and the House of Blades, although they do not have relationship these
years, but they are both subjects of the crown. Since we are now all in the
City of the Six Crafts, we are on the same boat. Even if you are dissatisfied
with me, we should defeat the enemy first, then we can talk about other
things.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Why are you here? Was
it for the jade?”</p><p>Cui Buqu remained silent for a
while, “No. Two months ago, I am already in the City of Six Crafts, how would I
know that the jade would be stolen? The Zuoyue Bureau has something we needed
to do.”</p><p>Feng Xiao sighed, “Until now, QuQu
you refuse to be honest with me, it would be very difficult to convince me that
you are trustworthy!”</p><p>Cui Buqu rolled his eyes, “The Khan
Ishbara is on the move and has set his eyes upon the Central Plains. However,
although there are many Turkish officials, the Khan’s powers are not enough to
conceal all that he did. My mission, is to aid the imperial court to foil the
Turk’s plans. This is originally a secret of the utmost confidentiality. All
who is not involved are not permitted to ask, so I can only tell you until this
point. With your intelligence, it is not difficult for you to guess the rest. I
need not tell you more either.”</p><p>Feng Xiao remained in silence. In
the dark, Cui Buqu also could not see his expression, he only felt that Feng
Xiao was trying to determine how much of his words were truth.</p><p>Who knew that the other suddenly
asked, “So if what you said is true, then Wen Liang is also a distraction you
created?”</p><p>Cui Buqu said nothing.</p><p>His silence meant that he did not
deny it. With such a lead, Feng Xiao could guess the rest of the story and
everything he encountered in this case. Also Cui Buqu had been by his side all
these while, even drugged with the Naihe drug until he looked weak and sickly,
but Feng Xiao was unaware been led by the nose and walking around in circles.
He could not help feeling that his fingers itch, and that he really wanted to
take the other’s head, throwing down onto the ground and kick it around.</p><p>Then he reflected on himself, who
thought that he was on the winning side, yet he was fooled so easily by the
other.</p><p>It was not easy for him to hold
himself in place and curb his temper. Feng Xiao laughed, “Then can I trouble
Master Taoist Cui to clarify yourself? The few people who accused Wen Liang,
were they also people you have planted to mislead me?”</p><p><b>Pinched his nose</b>: In the novel, it said ‘held his throat’ but I felt this aligns more
with English.</p><p><b>Zuoyue Bureau</b></p><p>: Used to be called Zuoyue Alliance. I felt that
this was more fitting, now that I’ve read up to nearly the end of the story.
Sorry for the name change!
