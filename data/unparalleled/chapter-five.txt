<br><h2>Chapter 5 – It Does Not Matter Whether One is Crippled, As Long As There is Still Breath in Him</h2><br><br>
<p>If manor, if
compared, did not look much different like the others.</p><p>At the most,
the window papers were thicker and the roof was lower than other houses.
Sunlight inside the manor were so dim that even in the daylight, candles were
lit all over the place. It created a strange feeling of being oppressed.</p><p>Other than
that, the furniture was completed. By the looks of them, they stilled looked
new. Even the gap between the wooden planks did not gather dust.</p><p>Cui Buqu cast
over the entire place. “No one lives here, yea?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
smiled gently, “There is, only, they were merely servants and maids. I allowed
people to refurbish this place so it could be a temporary torture chamber of
the House of Blades.”</p><p>Being faced
with such threat, barely even veiled, Cui Buqu, “You mean, right now you’re
going to enforce punishment on me?”</p><p>Feng Xiao bent
slightly, levelling his gaze with Cui Buqu’s, “Just look at yourself—your
reaction. You don’t act or look like an innocent person at all. Can I not be
suspicious of you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu
responded helplessly, “Be a little more reasonable. If I were to wailed of
being framed, would you have let me go? Even if Lady Qin had any relationships
with the Zixia Taoist Temple, that is in the past. I do not know that woman! I
imagine you have already searched the temple from top to bottom, did you find
anything suspicious?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The
grander White Cloud Temple in the city, why did you not go there?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I
rather lead a pack of chickens, than live at the tail of a phoenix. Zixia
Temple was abandoned. If I could raise it back into glory, would that not bode
well for me? Better than living under the orders of someone else. Surely, you
accept this reason?”</p><p>Feng Xiao shook
his head. “No, it does not make sense. Two months ago, Linlang Alliance sent
out news that they would be carrying out an auction in the City of the Six
Crafts. At the same time, you arrived. The coincidence is suspicious in itself.
The Khotan ambassador died, Lady Qin and the jade went missing. For all we
know, the jade might even appear at the auction hall. Why did you come? Lady
Qin? Or the jade? Where are the things hidden? Zixia Taoist Temple, or the
Linlang Alliance’s auction?”<br>
<br>
Cui Buqu. “The more you speak, the more I fail to understand you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“That is fine. You can take your time here considering. When you’ve made a
decision, you can come to me.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “My
health has never been well. I’m afraid I won’t be able to stand any form of
punishment.”</p><p>Feng Xiao spoke
meaningfully, “Did you think that physical pain in the only unbearable pain in
the world?”</p><p>That was all he
said, not even awaiting a reply from Cui Buqu, before walking out.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
casts a glance at Cui Buqu before he left as well.</p><p>In the blink of
an eye, everyone in the house dissipated.</p><p>The few candles
left were extinguished and when the door closed, the manor plunged into
darkness.</p><p>After that, the
curtains outside were also pulled down. No one knew what orders Feng Xiao gave,
for every window was sealed from the outside and covered up with a black cloth,
shutting out every single trace of light.</p><p>In the manor
now, one could not even see their own fingers should they extend their hand.
From the outside, nevermind if there was someone walking around, the one inside
would not be able to hear even the sound of insects or birds.</p><p>The silence of
the night brings deep saddened thoughts, as well as the sorrow of scholars, but
this particular silence is one that is accompanied with the gentle breeze and
bright moon. Once silence reached its peak, it could morph into something
extremely terrifying.</p><p>Cui Buqu’s face
paled the moment he walked towards the closed doors, &nbsp;no longer the helplessness and anger he had
expressed just now.</p><p>When the black
curtains were put over the windows just now, he even snorted.</p><p>Cui Buqu knew
what the other man wanted to do.</p><p>For one to lose
all their senses, to exist in a void of emptiness, one’s mind can drift into
uncharted places, allowing themselves to be consumed by their thoughts.</p><p>Without the
voices of people, even if they shouted and screamed, the only voice they would
hear is their own. To not know whether on the outside, if it was broad daylight
or late night—be it two days or even longer, by the fourth or fifth day,
perhaps even after ten days or half a moon, they will soon forget time.
Finally, they wouldn’t even know if they were still alive or dead, whether
they’re still in the world of the living or in hell.</p><p>Even for the
toughest men, they would cower and weep for forgiveness with consistent
tortured such as this.</p><p>Cui Buqu has
once seen a pugilist with two long swords from the famed <b>Jiangdong Wulin </b>living
under a similar environment for half a month, when he finally emerged, his body
was riddled with scars that he had craved himself. He had been injuring himself
to remind him that he was still alive.</p><p>A method that
could kill such as this, yet not drawing even one speck of blood. This is the
method of the House of Blades.</p><p>Now, these sort
of method are used on him, Cui Buqu.</p><p>He thought that
Feng Xiao had been prepared prior. Even if Cui Buqu had tricks up his sleeves,
to live in this manor for half a month, it was impossible that he would make
it. When the time comes, he would answer each and every question he has to ask.
How perfect.</p><p>Cui Buqu picked
up the mat and walked around the house. When he found a pillar, he sat next to
it with his legs crossed.</p><p>He had no
knowledge or skills in martial arts, but he’s learned some techniques about
meditation in the past. As he closed his eyes, he begins to release his mind,
feel his environment and exclude himself from all unnecessary thoughts.</p><p>Although some
monks and Taoists could sit like this for a dozen days, but those are people
who had trained since they were very young. They go out on fieldtrips often and
could even fight a winning match against ten normal people in less than ten
moves.</p><p>Cui Buqu
wouldn’t even know how long he would stay like this, but one thing he knows is
that Feng Xiao would never let him off that easily.</p><p>Those of the
House of Blades would only know how to use these methods to get what they want.</p><p>…..</p><p>“My Lord, it’s
been three days.” Pei Jingzhe places container of new tea leaves down as he
said.</p><p>“En, three
days. So what?” Feng Xiao’s head was tipped down, reading the reply he’d just
gotten from Qiemo as he answered Pei Jingzhe calmly.</p><p>“That Master
Cui has been in the manor for three days. He had no knowledge on martial arts.
If this continues, I’m afraid something bad will happen.” Pei Jingzhe reminded
cautiously.</p><p>“Your own hands
are stained with as much blood as all of us. Why are you suddenly feeling
sympathy for a Taoist?” Feng Xiao raises his head to look at him.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
exclaimed, “I am simply worried this would hinder your advancement on the case.
If he really is suspicious, if he’s dead, wouldn’t you have lost one important
lead?”</p><p>Feng Xiao did
not respond to him. He gave him the letter in his hand instead.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
accepted the letter and read it carefully, “It really is the Tianchi Yudan! In
order to gain the trust and favour of the emperor so his Majesty would sent
soldiers to solve the Turk problem, this Khotan King really did gave his
everything!”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Yuchi Jinwu is dead. The Khotan King would sent more ambassadors here to deal
with the case clearly. It is expected for the Tianchi Yudan should be found
too.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
gave a stiff smile, “If this case is solved, I fear you could no longer avoid
the Xingtai Princess. Is this also not compromising your original intentions of
leaving the capital…”</p><p>Before he could
finish his sentence, Feng Xiao cuffed him lightly. Pei Jingzhe almost bit his
tongue. Quickly gathering himself, he puts on a serious look back, “According
to my judgement, the disappearance of Lady Qin is related to the <b>Jade of
Heaven’s Lake</b>. If we are able to find her, then we would be able to find
the jade.”</p><p>They lost the
jade on the outer skates of the city. Carrying the jade, the culprit could only
go to two places: The City of Six Crafts or Qiemo County.</p><p>However, Qiemo
leads to Khotan, going there would mean going back. It’s impossible that the
culprit would bring the treasure and hide in the wild for all these time. So
the only possible conclusion is that they’re still in the City of Six Crafts in
hiding, making use of the Linlang Alliance’s auction event to send it away in
secrecy.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Now that we know it is related to Lady Qin, there are three clues altogether.
The Jade Buddha Temple rings no alarms as of now. That might just be a place
for Lady Qin to appear normal and blend into society. At Zixia Taoist Temple,
I’ve brought a few people to search the place and there is nothing suspicious
either. Finally, the house of the aunt Qin Miaoyu used to live in. Her family,
all six of them, old and young, died in a fire a while ago. The coincidence is
that when they died, it is the same time Yuchi Jinwu departed from Khotan.”</p><p>After a while,
Feng Xiao did not interrupt him, so Pei Jingzhe continues, “So I suspect that
this Qin Miaoyu might be a false identity from the beginning. She accumulated
and laid in hiding only so she can wait for the day that Yuchi Jinwu’s got
interested in her and so she could go to Khotan with him and get near to the
Jade of Heaven’s Lake.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “She
was his concubine for four to five years. How could she anticipate this would
happen, a whole four years ago, that Yuchi Jinwu would be travelling to the
Central Plains?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was
stunned, realizing the mistake in his trail of thoughts, “Than, could it be
that the real Qin Miaoyu was switched out before the Yuchi was chosen as the
ambassador?”</p><p>If they were
planning to frame the Sui Dynasty for the ambassador’s murder, the best course
of action would be to murder Yuchi Jinwu in the Sui Dynasty’s palace and steal
the jade there. This is the most effective way to turn Khotan and Sui into
enemies.</p><p>However, should
they have chosen this method, as Jinwu’s concubine, Lady Qin would have to
enter the kingdom and interact with her old acquaintances in the City of Six
Crafts. Her identity might be revealed and it would be very easy for her cover
to be blown by her most beloved aunt and her family. This is why her aunt had
to die. </p><p>Perhaps there
were some changes to the original plan and forced Lady Qin to carry her plan
out much more earlier than intended. Perhaps the ones who did the murder were
not allied with Lady Qin. With all these loopholes in the mystery, it would be
impossible for them to find answers at the drop of a hat.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
said, “I’ve followed your orders and allowed the County Magistrate Zhao monitor
those who enter the city every day, inspecting them personally to ensure they
carry nothing suspicious in or out the city. However, there are some issues on
the side of the Linlang Alliance.”</p><p>Feng Xiao’s
forehead wrinkled, “What troubles?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
gave a bitter smile, “The Linlang Alliance holds the support of the Longxi Li
Sect and the Boling Cui Sect, and they also have the support of the Princess
Leping. His Majesty often feels guilt towards the princess and tolerated her on
many occasions—you know this. If the culprit is making use of this fact, then
it would not be difficult for them to smuggle the jade out of the city.”</p><p>Feng Xiao rose
to his feet, “So what if there is the princess? Wouldn’t she have to kneel
before her father and brother and follow their orders? When will the auction of
the Linlang Alliance begin?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Tomorrow. I’ve orders scouts to keep an eye on the activities going on in the
auction. If there is anything suspicious, immediate action will be taken.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Yuchi Jinwu’s murder took place outside the city. This is a serious issue.
They would not be so careless in the future. Caution, for them, is only
natural. You…”</p><p>Before he could
finish his words, a man from the House of Blades rushed in.</p><p>“My Lord, there
is a brawl in Ruyi Tavern, someone died! County Magistrate Zhao has already
sent for people to invite you to take a look.”</p><p>On normal
cases, no one would dare to bother members of the House of Blades. If County
Magistrate Zhao sent people for him, it can only mean that he dare not offend
both parties involved in the incident and wanted him to secure the fuss.</p><p>Feng Xiao
hummed, “I will be there.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
quickly stopped him, “My Lord, not to fast! If that Master Cui refused to bend
the knee, what should be done?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Use
the Naihe drug on him.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe’s
shocked expression was obvious, “What if he could not stand it…”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “It
matters not if it crippled him, as long as a breathe remains is fine.”</p><p>His face calm,
expressionless, as if nothing was really unusual.</p><p><b>Jiangdong
