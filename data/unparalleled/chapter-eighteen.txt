</p><h2>Chapter 18 – How Will The Oleander Witch Solve This Now?</h2><br><br>

<p>It
was difficult enough to look for a one treasure of this standard, where would
one find another?</p><p>Cui
Buqu reached out and rested his hand on top of the jade stone, feeling a tingle
of coldness radiating from his palm.</p><p>All
three of them present had never seen the real Jade of Heaven’s Lake, therefore,
they naturally do not have any way of identifying it.</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “What did they say on the Lanling Alliance’s side?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “I have asked people from the Lanling Alliance. Yesterday, an old
servant with grey robes came along and gave them the jade placed in a very
common looking chest. He claimed it to be a family heirloom, but because they
were facing dire circumstances, he came here to pawn it. Originally, the
Linlang Alliance would not have accepted these things that had no backing to
them. They fear it might be stolen property, and that it would destroy the
Linlang Alliance’s name. However, since it came at the right time, Wen Liang
reconsidered it and decided that if it was indeed stolen, he could still simply
bring it to the auction, so when the owner recognizes it, they could return it
to him, so he decided to accept the jade.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “If they were to decide against auctioning it, what would they do with
it?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “According to their rules, they would keep it for a year. If there was
no one still who came to claim it, then they will release it to be auctioned.
Now, they have only brought forth a year doing so.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Would the Khotan kingdom send another ambassador here?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe looked at Feng Xiao. With a nod from his commandant, he told Cui Buqu,
“Yes. The Khotan kingdom would send a new ambassador and he is already on his
way. We have men waiting at Qiemo to receive them. However, at the very least,
it might take them three to five days before they can arrive in the City of Six
Crafts.”</p><p>That
would also mean that within these three to five days, no one would be able to
verify whether the jade in their possession now is the real Jade of Heaven’s
Lake.</p><p>Cui
Buqu caressed the jade and said, “Today when you claimed the jade, at least ten
people were glaring at you for a long time. Three of them were displeased, two
of them had killing intents.”</p><p>He
even noticed this? Pei Jingzhe felt a little shocked and could not help but
ask, “Who?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu proceeded really spill his analysis, “The three who furrowed their brows
in displeasure are: Jinhuan group Leng Dou; Khotan top millionaire, Zhou Pei;
Anlu Zhang Sect’s Zhang Yingshui. The two that held killing intents: one is a
black-clad Turkish, and the other one is a man wearing grey robes, looking
around twenty-five to twenty-six, and wore a bamboo hat. I have never seen
these two men before, therefore I am unable to determine their identity.”</p><p>“Turks?”
Pei Jingzhe reacted sensitively to the word.</p><p>However,
Feng Xiao looked amused, “Whether this jade if the real one or not, once it is
in my hands, it is not surprising a handful of people would come to our
doorstep.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “That is correct.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe said in agitation, “Would they be willing to go against the House of
Blades?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu laughed in ridicule, “The House of Blades may have the Emperor’s blessing,
even the Three Departments and Six Ministries would have given you people face;
but what are they in the province of Jianghu? This jade is ethereal, possessing
the ability to raise one from the dead, why is it not worth it for them to
fight for it?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe’s jaw fell wide open. He wanted to talk back, but he could not think of
anything to say.</p><p>Feng
Xiao gave a light laugh.</p><p>“The
weather is bitter and cold. After standing outside for so long, why don’t you
come in and have some tea?”</p><p>Is
there someone outside?</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe immediately twitched his ears. His martial arts were not bad, but from
just now, he did not even realize there was someone outside.</p><p>Suddenly,
at this moment, the feather-light voice of a woman, like glistening water,
sounded.</p><p>“I
only fear that the house is too crowded, that there is not enough space.”</p><p>There
it was!</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe immediately stood up.</p><p>Feng
Xiao simply took the jade’s chest and threw it against the room’s door.</p><p>Of
course it was not his intention to drill a hole into the door to throw the
chest outside the room. Once the chest hit the door, it bounced back, and so
did the door, opening widely by itself. This is a technique that only
high-level martial artists knew.</p><p>The
wind followed, flowing into the room from the opening. The shadow of a
yellow-clothes woman immediately fill the gazes of the three of them. The woman
was sitting on the roof of the residence opposite of them, both legs hanging
down freely.</p><p>She
looked very normal without a hint of fear or nervousness. When compared to Feng
Xiao, it was like the cloud and the earth. Once their mouths open, it was
impossible to recognize the wrong person.</p><p>“It
is very late in the night, I would feel very shy to disturb you at an hour like
this. However, if Lord Feng would allow me to take a look at the jade, I would
leave once I’ve caught a glimpse of it.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe followed Feng Xiao out of the room and immediately realize that the
yellow-robed woman is not along. On the top of the left, right roofs, and under
the tree on the left, there were three others.</p><p>One
was wearing a white veil, clad in all white from head to toe. It was impossible
to even tell their gender.</p><p>Another
was tall and had tints of yellow in his hair. With a glance, it was obvious
that he was an exotic man.</p><p>Without
so many high-level martial artists standing outside, he himself did not even
realize something was wrong. What it this mean?</p><p>It
means that if anything happened, he would not be able to serve Feng Xiao the
way he wanted.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt his body drenched in cold sweat all of a sudden.</p><p>The
yellow-robed woman noticed his nervousness and laughed lightly, “Little lord,
don’t be afraid. I am not with them.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu cough in a low voice before walking out slowly.</p><p>Compared
to the way those outside were dressed, Cui Buqu was wrapped tightly around his
body. The colour of his face looked as white as snow; at once glance, it was
easy to tell that he was sick all his life, as if he couldn’t even manage to
live past the next few days. His footsteps were also light, showing that he
knew nothing of martial arts. </p><p>Everyone’s
gazes fell upon him, then turned away and did not thought of him much.</p><p>Feng
Xiao approached confidently without even a trace of being nervous. Instead, he
looked as if he was waiting for this to happen since a very long time. His eyes
glowed excitedly, blinking like a dazzling array of stars.</p><p>“There
are two more. Why don’t you all come out?”</p><p>Everyone
present said nothing, as if they were waiting for the last two to emerge from
the shadows.</p><p>The
quietness lasted for a long while only did one shadow came out in slow steps.
From their figures, they looked like two tall women, but half of their body
were still hidden from shadows.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe slow in a low voice, “Who else is the other! What are you trying to prove
by hiding?”</p><p>The
yellow-robed woman said, “That person has left, if not wrong, it should be one
of the assassins from the <b>Yunhai
Thirteen Stories </b>organization.<b></b></p><p>As
soon as he heard the name, both Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu’s gaze shook a little.</p><p>Yunhai
Thirteen Stories is a new secret organization in the Jianghu province. Their
profession was murdering people for gold. In this world, there is bound to be
some people whose existence was a threat to another, so if it was not
convenient for them to dirty their own hands, or if they are in no power to
kill them, they would employ the Yunhai Thirteen Stories.</p><p>It
was said that the Yunhai’s business was not bad at all, but they were growing
bolder by day and even dared to assassinate imperial officials. Last month, within
the ministry of justice, one official fell dead. After investigation by the
House of Blades, it was discovered that his death was suspicious and related to
murder. So the Yunhai Thirteen Stories have been on the House of Blade’s
tracking records ever since.</p><p>The
things did by assassins, most of the time, are illegal, therefore, when they
saw that Feng Xiao was not an amateur, and that there were so many other highly
skilled martial artists present, they knew that they could not take advantage
of the situation, so naturally they hid in the shadows. </p><p>However,
only one had left, five remained.</p><p>Cui
Buqu’s gaze swept the area and coughed twice, but it was only to cover his
amusement.</p><p>It
would be interesting to know how that oleander would deal with a kind of
situation such as tonight.</p>
