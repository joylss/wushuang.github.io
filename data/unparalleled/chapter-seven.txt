</p><h2>Chapter 7 – A Stubborn Body That Even Naihe Drug Is Unable To Tame</h2><p>Amidst the
grand city of Beijing, rich folks wandered here and there, low-ranking staffs
are no better than dogs, and even some princes who did not gain the favour of
the court are even more worthless than pennies. </p><p>However, the
current Emperor is an exception. From the time since the current Emperor is
still an official of the court, with only his wife, Lai Dugu, by his side, she
wasn’t like other women who only knew how to hide behind her husband for
protection. Many conquests achieved by Yang Jian was thank to Lai Dugu’s
contribution. After Yang Jian’s ascension, Lan Dugu ruled by his side and
became Empress Dugu, supporting her husband behind his back and ruled over the
court together. Everyone saw her as the second in power next to the Emperor.</p><p>Many people
also deducted that, between the Emperor and the Empress, not only are they
loving, but they are also very in sync and helped each other often. Between
them, none can be without the other. Because of Empress Dugu, the current
Emperor’s position as the Emperor is more secured than any Emperors before him.
Additionally, the Emperor has pledged an oath that he will never take in
another wife, thus, every prince and princess are sons and daughters of the
current Empress.</p><p>Princess
Leping’s situation is slightly special. Not only is she the Empress’ own
daughter, but she is her eldest daughter, and because she experienced a lot of
things at a young age, both Emperor and Empress loved her dearly that they
would never refuse any of her wishes. When Princess Leping’s people walked out
in the streets, every also treated them with at least three degrees of respect.</p><p>Princess Leping
had a daughter with the former Emperor, Yu Wenzhao. Her daughter’s name is <b>E
Ying</b>. Since she lost her father at such a young age, but she had the
protection of her mother and grandfather who did not mind the identity of her
father, she was also deeply loved, that the milkmaid who took care of her also
raised up the ranked and gained some acknowledgement. Half a year ago, her
milkmaid’s son got involved in a case and was held by the House of Blades. The
milkmaid pleaded Yu E Ying, and so Yu E Ying went to her mother for help. </p><p>The princess
only had one daughter and could not bear to see her daughter in pain, so the
princess took the lieutenant from her house to the House of Blades and demanded
them to release the milkmaid’s son.</p><p>The House of
Blades has three commandants. The First Commandant is the head of the
Department of Justice. He did not care much for what happens within the House
of Blades. The one who held real power over the House of Blade is its Second
Commandant Feng Xiao.</p><p>On that day,
there weren’t many people. Later on, someone spread rumours that the princess
had brought people to the House of Blades. Since the princess is there, the
lieutenants refused to relief himself of his sword despite the Blade Stone
being present. The princess also tolerated him, then both parties had a
quarrel. Feng Xiao did not say much, he took the lieutenant’s sword, snapped it
into three pieces.</p><p>The lieutenant
was shocked beyond words. Before he could even react, he was pinned against the
Blade Stone with all three broken pieces of his own sword. Thankfully, the
swords only pierced his clothing and under his thighs, holding him in place. He
stood there, stunned, and too afraid to move.</p><p>Everyone was
shocked stiff and Princess Leping could not believe that someone in this world
still dared to do this in her face and humiliated her own people. When she
complained it to the Emperor, who knew, that the unlucky one isn’t the House of
Blades, and not Feng Xiao. The Sui Emperor only laughed and said, aye, this is
the queer temper of the second Feng. That lieutenant was then sent out of the
country and the princess was just comforted with a few words, then everything
was put behind them.</p><p>After that
time, not only the Princess Leping, but other commoners can also see that the
House of Blades is no small matter in the eyes of the Emperor. Feng Xiao is
also a treasured subordinate of the Emperor that he would even made Princess
Leping unable to do anything against him. </p><p>Feng Xiao’s
name travelled across Beijing. Even when others did not speak of it, people
from the princess’ house would definitely know about this.</p><p>So when this
person heard ‘House of Blades’ and ‘Feng Xiao’, his face changed immediately.
All he wanted to do at that moment is just to run away. He lost his previous
haughty behaviour entirely. </p><p>“Perhaps there
is a mistake. Since this is the House of Blades, I will not interfere in your
investigations, please!” That person laughed in a very ugly manner, his tone
quietened down a bit.</p><p>However, it is
not easy to get rid of the Second Commandant of the House of Blades. He raised
his hands and gestured an order, turning to County Magistrate Zhao, “These
people are related to the case. Bring them all back for questioning.”</p><p>County
Magistrate Zhao, “This……”</p><p>Feng Xiao did
not wait for him to finish talking before immediately getting up on his horse
and brought Wen Liang and the rest of the people involved away.</p><p>The people from
the princess’ house are not willing, but they could not do anything as they
were taken away, glaring at Feng Xiao with an angry look as they obeyed. Even
in Beijing, even if Princess Leping came herself, she would not be able to do
anything as well, never mind in a place such as this, even if Feng Xiao killed
him right here and there, he could still walk away like nothing happened.</p><p>Feng Xiao did
not question Wen Liang himself, instead, he have the case to County Magistrate
Zhao. </p><p>During this one
month, one thing after the other happened in the City of Six Crafts, and so,
County Magistrate Zhao could feel his headache getting bigger and bigger. He
could only give it his full attention, fearing Feng Xiao’s fury if he did his
job slowly. He did not dare to question men of Princess Leping’s house too
much, yet he managed to get the information from the sister. Very quickly, he
found the answer.</p><p>A few decades
ago, there were two families involved. One was the Ying family, and the other
was the Wen family. They were both businessmen of many generations and their
relationship was great. Originally, there was nothing much about them. They
were around the same level and were simply common merchants. However, because
the Wen family conducted business honestly, they quickly gained many networks
and business allies and in the end, became wealthy and powerful. On the other
hand, the Ying family had no such luck. Thus, bearing greed in his heart and
scheming with thieves. When the Wen family’s patriarch and his eldest son went
out on a fieldtrip, they were both murdered in cold blood. Since the Wen family
only left behind children and women, the Ying family took their business and
became wealthy themselves.</p><p>The second
young master of the Wen family was sickly and ill since he was young, so he
lived with his grandfather to be taken care of. Hearing this story, he grew
suspicious and investigated in secrecy, finding the answer in the end. Wen
Liang knew that during that time, he could not do anything to the Ying family
because of their wealth and power, so he left home to create a business on his
own, getting to know many rich and powerful people, and also got involved in
the Linlang Alliance, finding more and more about his father and brother’s
death.</p><p>At the same
time, a new Minister of Justice was appointed. Wen Liang took all the evidence
he gathered towards the Ying family and went to him, from the thieves to the
schemes, he showed them everything. Immediately, the Ying family was under
house arrest and investigation. All their riches and wealth were confiscated
and the Ying patriarch was sent out to the outskirts of the country. He died on
his journey there.</p><p>The young Ying
siblings escaped these faiths as they were still young. However, they grew to
hate Wen Liang, and they knew that, for who Wen Liang is now, is it difficult
to do plot anything against him. Since they could not kill him, so they thought
of a method that would bring both of them down at once. Ying Wuqiu drank some
poison at first then tried to fight with Wen Liang in a public place. He
allowed himself to be injured by Wen Liang, then the poison took effect and he
died on the spot. Wen Liang, naturally, could not escape a murder charge.</p><p>This case is
incredibly complicated, but County Magistrate Zhao saw the way Feng Xiao
treated the princess’ people and was afraid a small magistrate like him held no
value at all, so he worked day and night non-stop and investigated everything
and anything. Finally, they found the poison within Ying Wuqiu’s body and
proved that Wen Liang was innocent.</p><p>The Ying family
schemed against the Wen family first, and the Wen family repaid in kind. Wen
Liang told Feng Xiao that he did not know the Ying sibling, obviously lying in
his face, however, the relationship between the Ying and Wen family was too
complicated. When County Magistrate Zhao finally reported it to Feng Xiao, a
long time has passed.</p><p>But Feng Xiao
was not very interested in the case. His attention was on Wen Liang himself.</p><p>“The Wen
Family, except for Wen Liang, was there no one left?” He asked. </p><p>County
Magistrate Zhao shook his head, “Wen Liang still has a mother who is sick for
many years. He is very filial towards his mother. His mother is a buddist, and
was not permitted to such cruel methods. So during that time, Wen Liang only
targeted the father of the Ying family and allowed the young siblings to live.
I’ve sent men to question his mother, it seems everything fits in just right.
The doctor also said that Wen Liang’s mother is very weak, even medicine ceased
to work for her. She might not live for long.”</p><p>He held
intentions to get close to Feng Xiao, but he was also afraid. Since he has
nothing more to say, he quickly excused himself, thinking to himself how he
would ask Feng Xiao’s servants and the people around him, what he liked, so he
could send some gifts and earn his favour. If he could get the great and mighty
Second Commandant to his side and speak a few good words for him before the
Emperor, then he’d definitely didnt need to worry for his future.</p><p>Once County
Magistrate Zhao left, Pei Jingzhe said, “Young Master, that Wen Liang is indeed
suspicious!”</p><p>Feng Xiao could
not deny it, so he responded with an ‘En’. His voice was soft and gentle,
enough to cause one’s heart to quiver involuntarily. </p><p>Some people are
beautiful on certain features, but Feng Xiao is the type of beauty that was
beautiful in every angle. </p><p>But of course,
he is sharp, beautiful, and powerful. Such a beauty is indeed rare in this
world. When others gaze upon him, they can only bow down in admiration and
envy.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was
lost in his thoughts for a few moments. Just as he was wondering if Feng Xiao’s
parents knew what their son would become when he grew into an adult, so they
gave him such an odd and ethereal name? After a while, Feng Xiao clicked his
tongue impatiently, Pei Jingzhe quickly gather his thoughts.</p><p>“That Jade of
Heaven’s Lake could make one immortal according to the legends, or even bring
one back to life. Wen Liang’s mother is incurable, and he is incredibly filial
to his mother. Because his mother spoke, he let the Ying siblings go free, only
so they could return now for vengeance. If he is so loyal to his mother, then
there is his motive.”<br>
 <br>
Feng Xiao, “Continue.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Today outside Linlang Alliance’s hall, if it hadn’t been for you, Wen Laing
would have died without a doubt. Perhaps it’s because he was exposed and that
his accomplices were afraid he would expose them, so they took action first.”</p><p>“Also, in a
place like the City of Six Crafts, this place was never an important branch for
the Linlang Alliance. All the auctions that were done in the past were never
done in a place so far out like this. Isn’t it possible that because it’s more
convenient for them to go unnoticed here?”</p><p>“A few people
involved in this altogether. In my opinion, Wen Liang is more or less related
to the Khotan murder case and definitely linked to the Jade of Heaven’s Lake.”<br>
 <br>
Feng Xiao listened, but said, “Do you not feel this is too much a
coincidence?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
looked surprised, “Your meaning?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “We
are investigating Lanling Alliance, but Wen Liang came to us himself, it’s as
if someone brings a pillow just as you want to fall asleep. I cannot help but
be suspicious that someone is giving us a smokescreen.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
blinked. He felt that Feng Xiao might be thinking too much into it.</p><p>“I will order
men to keep an eye on Wen Liang to gather more information from his side.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
turned and suddenly he asked about Cui Buqu, “Have you used the Naihe drug? How
was the effect?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
answered with a strange look on his face.</p><p>“I did, but……”</p><p>But he wasn’t
able to finish his sentence.</p><p>Only when Pei
Jingzhe went to take a look, he was surprised that there still exist someone in
this world who could be immune to the Naihe drug.</p><p><b>E Ying: </b>read as ‘Nger-Ying’, not Eyeing.</p>
