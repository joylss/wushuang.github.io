<h2>Chapter 33 – I, From The House Of Blades, Would Not Be Afraid Of You!</h2>
<br><br>

<p>The
weather in this time of the year is cold, therefore even though Lady Lu has
slept in the coffin for two whole days, her corpse has yet to rot. However,
separated by life and death, to let her corpse see the light once again, all
the people of the Lu family could not help but took two steps back, all but Su
Xing who did not take a step back, in fact, he moved forward to look at the
person sleeping in the coffin.</p><p>Seeing
this, Madam Lu’s eyes suddenly brimmed red once more.</p><p>Lu
Ti could not suppress his regret. If he hadn’t been so blinded by wealth and
power, and wanted his daughter to marry someone she did not even know, they
would not have come to this.</p><p>His
heart was both pained and regretful, but he could not find an outlet to vent
them, so he only glared at Cui Buqu’s back angrily, furiously wanted to fight
him, but he was easily held down.</p><p>Cui
Buqu walked to towards the coffin, looking at the young lady lying in it with
both her eyes closed.</p><p>Her
face was already wiped clean and put on makeup, her clothes were also new. It
was impossible to imagine that she was fished out from the river.</p><p>Under
everyone’s eyes, Cui Buqu reached a hand out and touched Lady Lu’s face for a
moment, even opening her collar and flip the corpse over to touch a few more
places.</p><p>Lu
Ti’s eyes almost cracked, if he wasn’t held down, he would have rushed forward
and throw a fist at Cui Buqu.</p><p>Even
if he couldn’t do that, he, along with the Lu family people, scolded him in
loud and angry voices.</p><p>Cui
Buqu did not even raise his head, but he said impatiently, “Aside from Lu Ti
and Su Xing, silence the rest.”</p><p>Lu
Ti angrily, “Don’t think I will be grateful for this! My daughter is already
dead, do you want her to die without peace! I won’t let you off, House of
Blades!”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe almost choked, he coughed twice, “This Lord Cui is from the Zuoyue
Bureau, he is not one of the House of Blades!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu’s back was facing him, but he said slowly, “I am displeased to hear that, if
Feng Xiao had not given me the authority to investigate, how would I be
standing here? Old Lu, you are right to pin this blame on the House of Blades.”</p><p>Lu
Ti, “I do not care whether it’s the House of Blades or the Zuoyue Bureau, in
the end, the shame I have received today will definitely be remembered!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Don’t you get over yourself, even if people from the Fanyang Sect came,
I, from the House of Blades, would not be afraid of you!” </p><p>Qiao
Xian, Zhangsun Bodhi, “……”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe twitched his lips, feeling uncomfortable at Cui Buqu’s manner of
‘investigating’ the corpse, he felt that he was only using the opportunity to
sully the name of the House of Blades. He wanted to stop him, but could not
help widening his eyes.</p><p>Cui
Buqu bent down and inserted a hand into Lady Lu’s mouth, stretching his fingers
down her throat!</p><p>“You……”</p><p>He
squeaked a word, before Cui Buqu recoiled his fingers and looked at him as if
nothing out of the ordinary was happening, “Do you have a napkin?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe reluctantly took a napkin out from his sleeves and passed it over to
Cui Buqu. The napkin was something he had found cute while shopping the day
before, he had bought it so he could give it to someone else as a gift.</p><p>Cui
Buqu took the napkin and wiped his fingers.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt sick as he saw Cui Buqu wiped those grease on the napkin.</p><p>Yet
Cui Buqu acted as if it was nothing strange, instead he told Lu Ti, “You
daughter did not drown, she was murdered.”</p><p>Lu
Ti was already brimmed with fury, he could not believe what he had just heard,
“Don’t you just say whatever you want!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu extended a hand, on top of the napkin, there was something yellow.</p><p>“Before
Lady Lu died, what did she eat?”</p><p>Lu
Ti did not know, of course, he turned to his wife, and Madam Lu, too, did not
know. Wealthy families like them did not often live with their children, other
than every evening, they were seldom together.</p><p>At
that moment, Madam Lu called for her daughter’s nursemaid and servant for
questioning.</p><p>The
nursemaid was around forty years old and looked like an honest woman, the
servant looked fifteen or sixteen, and she look like any young female wearing
pink. She did not have any makeup on her, and she wore no ornaments either, but
on her clothes was a big lotus flower sown onto it, this was enough to make her
shine.</p><p>Cui
Buqu allowed them to speak about what happened to Lady Lu on the night she
died, and what they were doing at that moment.</p><p>The
nursemaid said that she was in the kitchen supervising a bird’s nest soup for
her, and that soup needed up to four hours to boil, it was meant for her to
drink before she slept, so at night she did not showed up and had no idea what
Lady Lu ate.</p><p>The
servant girl said, “That night, my Lady ate green bean cake, I am the one who
served it to her.”</p><p>Since
Lady Lu is the only daughter of the Lu family, she was addressed as ‘my Lady’.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Was anything different with her?”</p><p>The
servant girl looked at Lu Ti, “In the morning, my Lord summoned for my Lady,
she looked unhappy when she came back, so I asked, she refused to say, Master
Su invited her to see some flowers, she also refused, and remained in her
residence alone.”</p><p>The
nursemaid added, “Lotus is right, that morning, my Lady went to greet my Lord
in the morning, as she always did, but after four hours she wasn’t back yet, so
I felt strange and even sent someone to urge them, but my Lord said my Lady had
already left his place.”</p><p>Just
now, Lu Ti was blinded by anger and felt a little dizzy, but as he heard the
servants speak, he suppressed his fury and struggled to recall, “That’s right.
That day my daughter and I discussed about the Taiyuan royal family, my
daughter refused to marry him, said she and Su Xing loved each other, I……sigh,
If I knew this would happen, I would not have forced her!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “How long was the duration of the discussion?”</p><p>Lu
Ti, “Around an hour, her mother came to make peace, so I allowed her to go back
and think for herself, who knew she would…..”</p><p>Cui
Buqu asked again, “From your manor to hers, how long does the journey take?”</p><p>The
one who answered is the nursemaid, “The servants are swifter, we can reach
within 7 minutes, but my Lady walked very slowly, she would need around 15
minutes.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “You discussed for one hour, added with those 15 minutes, where was she
during the other 2 or more hours?”</p><p>Everyone
turned towards the servant that was always by Lady Lu’s side, “Lady Lu said she
wanted a breath of fresh air, so she walked a little slower.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu asked her back, “Is that so? Did she went elsewhere, but you refused to
say?”</p><p>Lotus
shouted,” I would dare not lie!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu said coldly, “Bring all the servants of this manor here, ask them who had
seen Lady Lu that day, then we know whether you lied!”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe did not understand why Cui Buqu jumped from examining bodies to
questioning Lady Lu’s servant girl, but he could see that Lotus panicked and
stuttered, seemingly as though she was hiding something, so he didn’t stop him
and just watched silently.</p><p>Lotus
really yielded and kneel to the ground, “Lady Lu went to look for Master Su!”</p><p>Lu
Ti knotted his eyebrows, without waiting for Cui Buqu to ask, he asked himself,
“Why did she went to look for Su Xing? Why did you lie?”</p><p>Su
Xing, “Uncle, I was drawing when cousin sister suddenly bulged in, crying, she
told me that you wanted her to marry someone else, so I tried to convince her,
it wasn’t easy to calm her down, then let her go back, I originally thought she
had already got over it, but I never expected her to just…….”</p><p>He
could not continue his words, his breathe was dark and sullen, and he looked
tired and lifeless.</p><p>Lu
Ti’s eyes were red again, tears practically flowing out, “I have failed you
both…….”</p><p>“Don’t
despair yet.” Cui Buqu cut him off, “Lotus, Su Xing had originally lived in the
Lu manor, and he also often hung out with them. If Lady Lu wanted to vent to
him, it is a very normal thing, why did you conceal the truth?”</p><p>Lotus
only begun stuttering, so Su Xing confessed himself, “I am the one who allowed
her to hide the truth. Because cousin sister and Uncle were fighting, if Uncle
knew that she came to look for me after, he might think that I am persuading
her to oppose the marriage, I wanted to avoid suspicion.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe couldn’t help saying out loud, “She argued with her father because of
you, but you want to save your own skin at this moment?”</p><p>Su
Xing laughed bitterly, “You people don’t know the hardship of living under
someone else’s roof. Cousin sister and I were in love, but I am a man with no
achievement, no business, and had nothing in life. Compared to me, the Taiyuan royal
family is more suitable for her than I can ever be. If I am in Uncle’s place, I
would have also wished for my daughter to marry into a good house!”</p><p>Lu
Ti did not know what to say, but regret flushed over his face.</p><p>Madam
Lu was worse than him, she lowered her head and cried bitterly.</p><p>But
Cui Buqu was unmoved.</p><p>“You
said you were painting. What were you painting?”</p><p>Su
Xing, “A picture of ‘Autumn Lotus’.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Bring the art to me.”</p><p>Su
Xing’s eyebrows furrowed, “Master Taoist Cui, this seems to be unrelated to my
cousin sister’s death?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe also thought that Cui Buqu’s question was too far-fetched, but Cui Buqu
remained, “Bring all the art from your room to me, even the Autumn Lotus, bring
them all here.”</p><p>Madam
Lu could not bear it anymore and said, “Master Taoist Cui, my daughter……”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “It is related to your daughter’s death.”</p><p>Lu
Ti did not know what to think, to he gestured for the servants to follow his
orders.</p><p>The
art pieces were all brought here very quickly.</p><p>An
entire chest. These were what Su Xing painted on normal days. Cui Buqu allowed
Qiao Xian to unroll them one by one, and inside them were mostly different
types of lotus flowers, there were fresh lotuses, and even lotuses that have
wilted.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe was unfamiliar to art, but even though he wasn’t familiar, he knew at
the very least, a little bit. He could tell that Su Xing’s artistic abilities
were quite average, in other words, he had some charm to him, but perhaps not that
much talent, otherwise, he wouldn’t have been a ward under the Lu family for so
many years. He would have made his own world.</p><p>With
the coffin as the centre, more than ten scrolls of different lotus flowers were
opened, yet Lady Lu slept peacefully in the coffin, making the scene look like
an extraordinary sight.</p><p>“Lotus.”
Cui Buqu asked suddenly, “Does your Lady treat you well?”</p><p>The
servant girl was taken aback, she quickly said, “The Lady treats me very well.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Then why would you betray her, and help the man who killed her keep a
secret?”</p><p>As
he said that, everyone present let out a gasp.</p><p>Lu
Ti said disappointedly, “Master Taoist Cui, what are you talking about!”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Your Lady’s death, is not an event for you to wear pink, and to think
you even wore a pink robe with lotus flowers sown onto them, and your name is
also Lotus, is it not a coincidence that Su Xing also liked to paint lotus
flowers? Speak for yourself, would there be anything that happened so
coincidentally?”</p><p>Su
Xing said coldly, “Master Taoist Cui, watch your tongue! Lotus likes lotus
flowers, only because her name is Lotus, how does that have anything to do with
me!”</p><p>“Is
that so?” Cui Buqu laughed and asked the housekeeper and Madam Lu, “Was Lotus
called lotus even before she became a servant of the Lu family?”</p><p>Madam
Lu shook her head, she still cared a lot for her daughter’s servants, “She used
to be called Ten, because she was the tenth among her siblings, her family is poor,
so she was bought when she was six years old, just two years ago she changed
her name to Lotus.”</p><p>Cui Buqu turned towards Su Xing, “Then, two
years ago, you were already in this manor.”</p><p>Su Xing, “Then what does that prove?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Just now when I put my fingers
into Lady Lu’s mouth, she ate green beans cake on the night she died, some
leftovers of it still remained in her mouth. If she drowned, water would enter
he mouth and nose and would have washed away all those leftovers, but her mouth
had no water or dirt, even the leftovers of her food were still present, this
meant that she was already dead before she was tossed into the water, so her
mouth and nose were &nbsp;shut, and water
cannot enter!”</p><p>Lu Ti started struggling suddenly, under Cui
Buqu’s orders, he let him go. Lu Ti fell to the ground but rose up again and
bend over the coffin to look.</p><p>Cui Buqu turned towards Su Xing, “On the
night Feng Xiao brought the jade back from the auction, and all the top martial
artists gathered in the Qiushan manor, the one that wore black and hid in the
dark, was you, wasn’t it?”</p><p>Su Xing said coldly, “Master Taoist Cui, if
you wanted to frame me, of course you would push everything onto my head!”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “You were the one who brought that
jade to the Linlang Hall, your goal is to test the response of everyone, draw
your accomplice out, so you weren’t the same with the others, you weren’t there
for the jade, but you were hiding in the dark and observing. Once you
acknowledge that your accomplice was not present, you left immediately. You did
not stop even for a second. Do you know why I was able to recognize you?
Because that night, that man used his left hand to hold the wrist of his right
hand, the same as you are doing now. You can hide your face, but the actions of
your body would never lie!”</p><p>Su Xing was unmoved by his words, he remained
all the same, “That’s only because I paint too often and used my wrist too
much, so sometimes it hurts a little. Scholars were also mostly like this, if
you don’t believe me, you can just look for any scholar and ask!”</p><p>Once he finished speaking, Zhangsun
immediately attacked him from behind, the wind from his palm strong and full of
force. He used eighty percent of his strength, as if he wanted to kill Su Xing
on the spot.</p><p>Su Xing knew he was in danger, but he
remained where he stood and did not move, allowing Zhangsun to do whatever he
wanted, but in the last moment, the latter retreated his palm.</p><p>Su Xing knew he did the right thing. They
just wanted to test him.</p><p>But Cui Buqu would not let him off so easily
today, “No need to keep pretending, just now when you wanted to avoid it, it
already proved that you knew martial arts, you are even a very skilled fighter.”</p><p>Su Xing laughed coldly, “You are only adding
more blame onto me. Why should I remain here to be humiliated by you people?
Goodbye!”</p><p>He flipped his sleeves and turned around to
leave, but as Qiao Xian moved, sword thrusting towards his back, killing intent
brimming in the air, bringing the wrath of a thousand soldiers on the
battlefield.</p><p>This sort of killing intent is easy to
detect, and it was different from Zhangsun Bodhi’s method of attacking. Su Xing
could no longer bare to pretend, so he could only leap into the air and avoid
it.</p><p>Once he moved, he had already exposed the
fact that he was a practitioner of the martial arts!</p><p>Since he was already exposed, he no longer
hesitated, his hand reaching to his waist, pulling out a long blade into sight.
Su Xing turned around and turned towards Qiao Xian, but switched his direction
midair and took Lu Ti as a hostage instead, the soft blade gloating over Lu Ti’s
throat.</p><p>“Don’t come here or I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Cui Buqu shook his head, “So what if you held
him hostage? Anything that my House of Blades wished to solve, we can be
hindered by no one!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “……”</p><p><i>Second
Commander, this man is using a feather and treating it like a sword, putting
all the blame and bad reputation on the House of Blades, why did you ask him to
help? Are you afraid that the House of Blades did not have enough enemies yet?!</i></p><p><b>Author’s
Note:</b></p><p>Cui Buqu: I, House of Blades, trying to farm
gold.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe: Help me.</p>
