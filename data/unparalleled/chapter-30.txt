<h2>Chapter 30 – Is Your Heart Moved?</h2>
<br><br>

<p>On Pei Jingzhe’s side,
once he arrived outside the Lu manor, he encountered a problem.</p><p>It was impossible for him
to patrol the entire Lu manor on his own. Even if someone sneaked inside, as
long as he is familiar with the place, it would not be difficult for him to use
a false identity or name. The only thing Pei Jingzhe could do was to announce
his identity to the Lu manor’s owner and obtain permission to guard the area
heavily, ensuring that not even a fly could sneak inside.</p><p>However, this would undoubtedly
alert the culprit and ruin an important lead.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was trapped
between a stone and a hard place.</p><p>He had always thought of
himself as immature, unlike Second Commander Feng, who smiled as his mind
worked quicker than anyone, solving every issue they came across, even the
Third Commander who was unparalleled in martial arts would not have stood here
not knowing what to do. At the very least, when the person left the Qiushan
manor, he would have already put him in chains.</p><p>As Pei Jingzhe made the
decision to sneak in, a sharp voice came from the Lu manor and pierced the
night, sending a twitching anxiety down his heart. </p><p>After that splitting
sound, up and down, the Lu manor lit the candles and lanterns as people rose
from their sleep from room to room. Pei Jingzhe could also feel a ruckus
rising.</p><p>It was impossible for him
to sneak into the manor now, Pei Jingzhe’s forehead wrinkled.</p><p>The sound of horse hooves
sounded in the distance. Pei Jingzhe turned his head around to see six members
of the Houses of Blades riding near.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “Were you
not supposed to remain at the Qiushan manor?”</p><p>The leader among then
clasped his fists together and bowed, “By orders of the Second Commander, we
are here to assist Master Pei!”</p><p>It took Pei Jingzhe a
while to respond to it. He knew that Feng Xiao knew that his would happen—that
he would be standing here, hesitating, and not knowing what to do—so he sent
people to aid him, giving him the boost of confidence to make a decision.</p><p>He said, “Spilt
yourselves up and surround the Lu manor. Without my orders, do not let anyone
out!”</p><p>The men obeyed.</p><p>Although the Lu manor was
huge, the members of the House of Blades were all exemplary fighters, so six of
them were more than enough.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe approached
the door and knocked before feeling a sudden wind rushing against his back. He
instinctively avoided it, glaring from the corner of his eyes, a white light whirled
past him—immediately piercing a hole in wooden door in front of him!</p><p>If the enemy was so
ruthless, Pei Jingzhe needed to put even more precaution into the manner. He
took a step back and draw his sword before immediately engaging in a fight with
the person who came to attack him.</p><p>As both of them faced
off, only did he realize that his opponent was wearing long white flowing
robes, as if they came from the moon place in the Heavens.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “Who goes
there!”</p><p>Qiao Xian laughed coldly,
“You took one of our people, and you dared to ask who we are? Give back Cui
Buqu!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was taken
aback, “You?!”</p><p>As his voice spreads into
the night, he saw another person emerging slowly from the darkness, wearing a
bamboo hat and blue robes, holding Buddha beads in his hands. He was a certainly
a sight.</p><p>“Vice-Commander
Zhangsun?”</p><p>Qian Xian insisted,
“Where is he?!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe calmed
himself down, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</p><p>Although chaos was
happening within the Lu manor, they were nowhere near deaf. The noise at the
door brought them up, running in a hurry immediately to open the door only to
see Pei Jingzhe and Qiao Xian were both fighting right at their doorstep. They
wouldn’t help but urged them, “Stop this nonsense quickly! Who in the world are
you people? How dare you fight in front of the Lu manor. Quick, get the men!”</p><p>Not far away, the men
from the House of Blades heard the commotion and rushed here immediately,
surrounding Zhangsun and Qiao Xian. All of a sudden, it turned into a dangerous
scene.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was left with
no choice and shouted, “Everyone stop!”</p><p>He took a step back first
to imply his intentions, and after he saw that no one was trying anything, he
let out an air of relief.</p><p>The people from the Lu
manor did not utter a word upon seeing such a strange scene.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was the one
who broke the silence, “Vice-Commander Zhangsun, may I ask why are you here in
the City of Six Crafts?”</p><p>It was impossible that
House of Blades and the Zuoyue Bureau had never met. At the very least, Pei
Jingzhe had seen the two Vice-Commanders before. Although now is not the time
to follow up on old days, but it was impossible for him to pretend that he did
not recognize Zhangsun.</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi, “To find
someone.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe smiled, “I am
bounded by duty as of now, once I am done with this and organized a banquet for
both of you, I will search with you, how does that sound?”</p><p>Qiao Xian said coldly,
“Give him back.” </p><p>Pei Jingzhe knew what she
mean, but he still feigned ignorance, “Give who back?”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “Cui Buqu!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe coughed
lightly, stomping his guilt down, “I apologize, I have not heard of such a person.”</p><p>Qiao Xian’s face was
brimmed with anger. She took a step forward and wanted to attack again, but was
held back by Zhangsun Bodhi.</p><p>“Give him back, or, do
not even think of leaving tonight.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe wasn’t
angered, instead he smiled, “Vice-Commander Zhangsun, you make such a threat!
But even if you are undefeatable, surely you cannot win against seven of us!”</p><p>Zhangsun Bodhi, “I can
try.”</p><p>As he said the last word,
his body moved vaguely and lunged at Pei Jingzhe at the speed of thunder.</p><p>The six men that
surrounded them were not quick enough. Zhangsun was already at the other’s side
and he held his shoulder.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe managed to
avoid the attack, but he only managed to draw his sword halfway out of its
sheath before it was pushed back into its sheath by Zhangsun.</p><p>Even after three times,
the same thing happened thrice!</p><p>Pei Jingzhe’s face
reddened.</p><p>When it came to martial
arts, he knew he was no match for the Vice-Commander of the Zuoyue Bureau, but
he did not expect himself to lose every shred of dignity at this moment that he
could not even draw his sword.</p><p>This is the utmost shame
for someone who practiced martial arts.</p><p>But strictly speaking,
Zhangsun Bodhi was already showing mercy. Otherwise, even with six other
members present, he could have easily killed Pei Jingzhe on the spot.</p><p>“Hand him over!” Zhangsun
Bodhi slammed his palm.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was
ultimately cornered, so he could only close his eyes as he gave in, “Qiushan
manor!”</p><p>The men all around him
gasped before swooping in, but they were already a step too late.</p><p>A heavy rush of wind
swept past them, yet they were gone in an instant. Pei Jingzhe opened his eyes
wide and realized that the other man had already stopped, his palm freezing in
the air.</p><p>Having just escaped the
Hell king’s grasp, he has yet to recover from his earlier shock, but Zhangsun
Bodhi had already flipped his robes and leaped into the air, pushing everyone
aside with both his palms. </p><p>None of the men from the
House of Blades were amateurs, even if they were released into the Jianghu world,
they were not far behind actual masters, yet they were so easily pushed aside
by Zhangsun without any opportunity of retaliating.</p><p>Watching this scene
happening before him, Pei Jingzhe could see that, even though Zhangsun’s
martial arts were still a bit behind Feng Xiao, he would not be very far
behind. Attempting to fight him just now just showed not ignorant he was.</p><p>Qiao Xian shot him a cold
glare, “Did you not say you have heard of no such person just now?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe laughed
awkwardly, “I did not know your intentions before. It’s not too much of me to
be wary, surely?”</p><p>Qiao Xian, “You already
knew that Cui Buqu belonged to our Zuoyue Bureau, yet you still tortured him.
The Zuoyue Bureau will definitely remember this debt. Once we take him back, we
will be coming back for you.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe felt a
headache coming up, “Although Master Taoist Cui is held under our custody, we
did not do much to him. My Lord practically brought him along no matter where
he........”</p><p>When he spoke until that
point, he could not help but felt guilty. Of course he couldn’t tell them that
they used the Naihe drug on Cui Buqu, and that it will take effect every three
to five days. He fell ill this morning, was taken by their lord to the crime
scene before he even recovered?</p><p>Qiao Xian glared at him,
noticing immediately that he was hesitating. She took a step forward and
grabbed him by the collar, “What did you do to him?!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe could not
believe that someone like her, who looked like an angel, would really grab him
like that. He almost could not breathe.</p><p>“Really, he is fine. If
you don’t believe me, I can take you to him. But first, we need to take care of
matters here first……”</p><p>“Who are you people, and
why are you behaving like brats in front of the Lu manor? Leave this place
immediately!” An angry voice interfered and broke Pei Jingzhe’s conversation.</p><p> The master of the Lu manor fumed at them
angrily, both his eyes red and puffy, but it was not out of anger that someone
had disturbed them in the middle of the night, it looked more like something
huge had happened within the household.</p><p>Remembering the sharp
scream he had heard earlier, Pei Jingzhe set aside Zhangsun and Qiao Xian
temporarily and ordered his men, “Surround the Lu manor immediately, do not let
anyone leave!”</p><p>Then he turned towards
the master of the manor, “I am from the House of Blades, came forth by orders
to investigate the murder of the Khotan ambassador, someone reported that a
suspicious figure is hiding within the Lu manor, please bare with it and allow
us entry to search your place!”</p><p>Lu Ti’s expression
changed immediately, as if he was injured by his words, but after listening to
Pei Jingzhe’s words, a nerve in his brain popped.</p><p>“This is the Lu manor,
not some place you can enter whenever you wish! The Lu family have always been
honest businessmen who abide the law, so what if you are the House of Blades,
does that give you the privilege to do whatever you please here?! I heard that
you people even arrested men from the Linlang Alliance’s place. Today, as long
as I, Lu Ti, is here, do not even think of stepping into my manor!” </p><p>He spoke like a wounded
lion, guarding his den with all the strength he has left and refusing to let
the enemy in. Pei Jingzhe could take his men and force his way in if he wanted
to, but if he did that, the Lu manor would descend into chaos, giving the
culprit the opportunity to escape.</p><p>“Everyone, tonight our
Lord has suffered enough. An unfortunate incident befell our Lady, for she had
drowned. As of now, the physician is still trying his best to save her, please
grant us this favour, show some mercy, and come back in a few days!”</p><p>The one who spoke was
someone who stood next to Lu Ti, who looked just as miserable, judging by the
looks of it, he must be the housekeeper.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe’s heart was moved.</p><p>They have just managed to
follow their lead here, and something immediately happened within the Lu manor.
This is too much of a coincidence.</p><p>Now, there was no need
for him to barge in, the Lu manor is undoubtedly already in chaos.</p><p>But also means that, he
could not leave now.</p><p>He struggled a little, but
as he recalled Zhangsun Bodhi, he dared not move. Qiao Xian glared at him
coldly before finally releasing his collar.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe let out a
breath and told Lu Ti, “Sir Lu, I am sorry to hear of your daughter, but tonight
we just discovered a lead, and in the blink of an eye, something happened to
your daughter. The coincidence of this is too suspicious, so please let us
investigate everything.”</p><p>Lu Ti, “There is no need!
Right now, I just want peace!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe did not pay
him any attention. He turned around and ordered his men to look for County
Magistrate Zhao to allow him to send more people to surround the Lu manor,
insisting that no one should leave the manor tonight.</p><p>Lu Ti yelled angrily,
“You really want to cross me tonight!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “I fear it
is you who is unwilling to cooperate. The House of Blades are doing their duty,
anyone irrelevant who interfered will be arrested similarly!”</p><p>He waved a hand and the
men rushed forth. The people of the Lu manor would not even be able to stop
them and watched as their master was held down.</p><p>Watching the Lu manor’s
servants wanting to fight his men for Lu Ti, Pei Jingzhe shouted again, “Who
else dares to rebel, I will kill Lu Ti on the spot!” </p><p>Lu Ti’s face switched in
between different shades of green, he bellowed, “You people really are lawless!
Do you not know what relationship I share with the Fanyang Lu Sect? I am
warning you!”</p><p>Qiao Xian laughed coldly,
“Nevermind how many generations is between your Lu family in the city and the
Fanyang Lu sect, even if you are a direct relative of the Fanyang Lu sect, in
the “Kaihuang Law” no law can let you take action against us. After all, all
the wealthy and royalty think too highly of themselves, otherwise how would
they die just because they’ve offended someone they shouldn’t?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe did not
expect Qiao Xian to &nbsp;speak up for him
like that. He could not help but stared at her.</p><p>Lu Ti was so angered that
he rolled his eyes and did not utter a word.</p><p>Tonight, something is
bound to happen.</p><p>As Pei Jingzhe wanted to
prepare to bring men inside, something really happened.</p><p>“Young Master Pei! Why
are you here? Something not good happened!”</p><p>One man flew to his side,
panting heavily, Pei Jingzhe recognized him as a servant from the Qiushan
manor.</p><p>When County Magistrate
Zhao offered the Qiushan manor for Feng Xiao to be his residence in the City of
Six Crafts, he also brought a few servants to attend to the guests. Those
people are quite intelligent. They wouldn’t ask more or things they shouldn’t
be concerned about. Even Feng Xiao who has always been incredibly picky was
unable to be picky with those servants.</p><p>But now, the servant
practically lost his breathe, running with a look of panic and told Pei
Jingzhe, “Lord Feng received a letter that said you were held hostage, the
other person wanted him to meet them in the Hulin forest. He allowed me to come
here to look for County Magistrate Zhao to surround the Lu manor and not let
anyone out, so he can deal with it when he’s back. But you—why are you here?
Unless Lord Feng was deceived?!”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe was taken
aback, “Did he went on his own?”</p><p>The servant shook his
head, “He brought… he brought Master Taoist Cui!”</p><p>At this moment, even Qiao
Xian and Zhangsun Bodhi’s faces turned white.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “How long
has it been since they were gone?”</p><p>The servant, “From the
moment I left the manor, they have been gone for around an hour!”</p><p>“If he wants to die
himself, it is fine, but he wants to take one of us with him. If anything
happened to Cui Buqu, I won’t let any of you off!” Qiao Xian and Zhangsun could
not care more and immediately headed to the outside of the city, not forgetting
to give a threat before they did.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe watched them
leave, finally feeling what Lu Ti felt a moment ago. Thankfully, County
Magistrate Zhao did not procrastinate, for immediately both men and horses
arrived. They were dressed messily: even their hair ornaments were hastily
worn. It could be seen that they came in a hurry, but Pei Jingzhe was in no
mood to praise him, so he only gave him an order and immediately brought two
men and headed towards Hulin forest.</p><p>……</p><p>The snow storm has
quietened down, but the cave was already in a cold state for a long amount of
time.</p><p>Feng Xiao used his inner
strength to expel most of the poison from his body, but there are still some
amount of poison felt in him, so he felt all four of his limbs numb, even his
body felt a little cold.</p><p>But more shockingly, Cui
Buqu’s body was radiating so much heat it was a little worrying. Holding him in
his arms, Feng Xiao felt like he was holding a hot iron, although it was great
to warm him up, but Feng Xiao suspect that if he continues to stay in his
condition with no backup, he might actually die.</p><p>It was difficult to meet
a soulmate, but even more difficult to meet a nemesis that rivalled yourself,
the latter was rarer and more precious than the former. Naturally, Feng Xiao
does not hope for Cui Buqu to die, he could imagine that if this person died,
he wouldn’t just go like that, but he would leave a bunch of traps and pits waiting
for Feng Xiao to fall into them.</p><p>So Feng Xiao thought that
no matter what, he would not let Cui Buqu die.</p><p> “Hey, say something.” He patted the other’s
face lightly—not too lightly—but Cui Buqu did not open his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t sleep. You won’t
be able to wake up.” Feng Xiao said, holding his hand as he transferred some
energy to him.</p><p>Perhaps transferring
energy did helped, because after a while, Cui Buqu stirred slightly from his
slumber, wrinkles appearing on his forehead.</p><p>Giving a response is a
good thing, Feng Xiao continued, “QuQu, what do you think of my looks?”</p><p>Cui Buqu’s lips quivered,
but he did not yield any sound.</p><p>Feng Xiao, “I know, my
looks are unparalleled, you don’t need to praise me. I am long used to these
sort of praises, seeing how you also wanted to praise my looks, you are no
different from the other people. However, today I want to tell you a story, a
story that happened when I was young.”</p><p>Cui Buqu closed his eyes
and let out a soft breath, as if responding to his words.</p><p>“When I was young I went
to explore the Southwest, and heard a story. A man who came from the local
tribe. A woman who is beautiful but she came from a poor family. She and the
man shared love at first sight, but after going through many difficulties, the
man was moved when he saw how much she did for him, so after convincing his
tribe, they arranged a marriage.” The more Feng Xiao spoke, the more excited he
sounded, “By chance I met that woman, and because she saw how beautiful,
elegant, and desirable I am, she begged me to do something for her. Could you
guess what it is?”</p><p>Cui Buqu looked
uncomfortable all over, but he wrinkled his eyebrows and finally opened his
eyes.</p><p>Feng Xiao felt him move
in his arms, as if he wanted to leave his hold, then he laughed, “I bet you are
also curious, why don’t you guess what she begged me to do. If you guessed
correctly, I will let you stay with me for a few days, giving you more chances
to admire my looks.” </p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>Even a dead man would
have twitched hearing that sentence, and to think that Cui Buqu wasn’t even
dead yet.</p><p>“Can you…….”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>His voice was weak, even
in a close distance such as this, Feng Xiao had to lower his head and bring his
ear close to Cui Buqu’s lips to hear what he wanted to say.</p><p>Cui Buqu seethe with mild
strength, “Shut up your dog mouth!”</p><p>He was originally only
half awake, his consciousness hanging by a thread, did not want to think about
anything but sleep for a good long hours, but who knew, there was someone
rambling nonsense in his ear like a fly buzzing around and refusing to leave
him alone. Cui Buqu really wanted to grab this “fly” and bury it somewhere
where it would never be found, let him reincarnate into a muted fly for the
next ten generations.</p><p>Feng Xiao wriggled his
eyebrows, “How could you say that? My mouth cannot be called a ‘dog mouth’, it
should be ‘jade mouth’. Everything I say is elegant and pleasant to the ear,
others only want to hear me say one sentence, yet I ignored them, but here you
sit in my arms wrapped around you in a hug, a privilege only granted by three
lifecycles of doing kind deeds. It’s something to be cherished.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>He admit that Feng Xiao’s
face was enough to cheat anyone in the world and make them fall to their knees.
No matter men or women, they would be seduced by it, but it the most important
thing is: if he refrain from opening his mouth, it would be the best.</p><p>The other man refused to
give up without finishing his story, Cui Buqu sighed and struggled to open his
eyes, but all he saw was darkness. He felt that he only needed to muster all
his strength and the consciousness he’s left, to fight against this sickening
feeling.</p><p>“……She wanted you to
seduce her fiancé, to see that whether he would be seduced by someone with your
looks.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “As expected
of someone I am interested in, then you could also guess the result.”</p><p>Cui Buqu answered
blandly, “With someone of your looks, even if you masqueraded as a woman, you
would definitely look attractive. Who of this world would not allow their heart
to be moved seeing such a beauty? Those who wouldn’t are few. Nevertheless,
your target is only an ordinary person, how could he resist your persistent and
perpetual seduction? Originally, the woman only wanted to test his
faithfulness, but in the end, she shot herself in the foot.”</p><p>“Then, what about you?
Has your heart moved?” Feng Xiao lowered his head, his breathe brushed against
Cui Buqu’s cheek.</p><p>If it had been before,
Cui Buqu would have raise a hand to push him again or leave on his own, but at
this moment, there was no strength in his left, so let alone raising an arm, he
could not even move his head.</p><p>“My heart is moved, does
not mean my feelings are also moved.” Cui Buqu said, his voice soft, “Feng Er,
with a face like yours, anyone—anyone at all—would find their hearts moving,
but not everyone’s heart would allow themselves to be played by you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao replied
innocently, “I am begged by someone else to test another person’s faithfulness.
That man could not resist my seduction, how would that be a fault of mine? The
hearts of men cannot stand themselves being tested. If they could, then it
means the tests have not reached their limits. Whether as husband and wife, or
as parents and child, it is all from the same concept. That woman was unable to
understand this, and in the end she was unable to accept the truth, thinking
that she would be an exception, is that not hilarious?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “What happened
to that woman in the end?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Guess.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “At the last
moment, the man had a change of heart, and fell in love with someone else. The
woman refuse to believe the truth, other than leaving the place for good, she
could only take her own life, aside from these options, the world would not
give her a third option.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Smart. That
woman leaped into the well and committed suicide. The man was sad for a while,
but after another two years has passed, he married someone else. From then on,
they lived happily forever. Speak for yourself, is this story of mine
excellent?”</p><p>Cui Buqu did not utter a
world.</p><p>Feng Xiao felt this was a
little unexpected, “I did not believe someone cold hearted like Master Taoist
Cui would believe that true love exist in this world.”</p><p>Cui Buqu replied coldly,
“If the world is heartless, that has nothing to do with me. I am only
interested to know when you can shut your mouth and let me have a good sleep.”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “Then, you are
bound to be awake for the entire night, because I want to tell you a new story.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>Feng Xiao did not stop
talking for the entire night, but later on, no matter how loud his voice is,
Cui Buqu could not help but already drifted into slumber.</p><p>He was originally half unconscious
because of the Naihe drug taking affect, but right now, his body temperature
has already dropped a considerable amount, his body was no longer hot in the
way that made Feng Xiao worried.</p><p>Feng Xiao felt that his
tolerance had also reached its limit, for he had talked until his throat and
tongue was dry, and he no longer wanted to move even an inch.</p><p>The snowstorm outside had
already stopped, and clouds filled the sky. From inside the cave, layers of
clouds were seen. It would seem, that a new dawn is awaiting them.</p><p>Feng Xiao sighed and
muttered to himself, “One night has gone by. Pei Jingzhe’s wage for the next
three years would be decreased by half.”</p><p>He got up slowly and put
Cui Buqu’s arm around his neck, half carried and half dragged him out of the
cave, his fingers pinching the other’s waist, wanting to wake him up.</p><p>“I want to carry you up,
move a little on your own. At the very least, don’t fall off when I carry you
on my back.”</p><p>Through the haze of his
sleep, Cui Buqu responded with a soft ‘En’, and listened to Feng Xiao’s orders,
both hands reaching up to his neck and heaved himself onto the other’s back,
obeying the entire process obediently.</p><p>This also means that he
had lost all judgement of his own.</p><p>Feng Xiao sighed again.
He quite liked the Cui Buqu that was conscious—the way he could weave all sorts
of schemes the moment his brain was free to think—that Cui Buqu was more fun
than the one now.</p><p>But the most important
thing is that, he needed to carry a grown man and climb all the way back to up
the cliff.</p><p>As he thought of this,
Feng Xiao muttered to himself again, “Pei Jingzhe’s wage for the next three
years are all waived, this can save the House of Blades some expenses.”</p><p><b>Author’s Notes: </b></p><p>Feng Xiao: The wind rose
again, Pei Jingzhe’s monthly wage is decreased by ten percent.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe: ??</p><p>Feng Xiao: It is now
raining, Pei Jingzhe’s monthly wage is decreased by twenty percent.</p><p>
