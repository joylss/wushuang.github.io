<br><h2>Chapter 13 – The Emperor’s First Move </h2><br><br>

<p>As soon as the words ‘bosom friend’
merged, Lin Wei immediately looked at Cui Buqu with hostility.</p><p>Since Cui Buqu knew of the rumours
concerning Lu Wei, of course he knew what was going on. Without even thinking
twice, he wanted to move Feng Xiao’s hand away from his shoulder, but who knew
the other man had his hand clasped tightly on him. No matter what he did, he
couldn’t move it an inch.</p><p>Lu Wei’s gaze flashed, and he
smiled, “To be able to be Feng-Er’s bosom friend, I believe Lord Cui must
surely be a man with commendable abilities. May I ask if Lord Cui is from the
Boling Cui Sect, or from the Qinghe Cui Sect?”</p><p>Cui Buqu looked at him blankly,
“Neither. I am just an ordinary person from no prominent sects.”</p><p>The more he speak in such a way,
the more Lu Wei was unable to determine his intentions.</p><p>Cui Buqu’s footsteps were weak and
light, his face looked pale and cold, his eyes looked burnout. It was very
clear to the eyes that he was not trained in martial arts. Instead, he seemed
like he was ill. It was confusing as to how someone like him could gain the
interest of someone like Feng-Er.</p><p>A few years ago, when Lu Wei met
Feng-Er, owning to the latter’s willingness to be less strict on the matter, he
was able to avoid some troubles.</p><p>At that time, it was as if Feng-Er
descended from the heavens, causing him to be bedazzled. From than onwards, he
had found no one else more attractive. However, Feng-Er was not interested in
him in the same way, additionally, his martial arts were unparalleled, so even
if Lu Wei wanted to force himself onto him, he didn’t have that opportunity. If
he didn’t deal with it properly, he might not be able to save himself. So all he
could do was restraining his feelings and desires while doing all he can for
Feng-Er, hoping he would reconsider it. However, Feng-Er was unpredictable and
Lu Wei knew very little of his identity. Even if he wanted to search for him,
he didn’t know where to look. So being able to see him in a place like this had
been a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Lu Wei thought of himself as being
handsome and gentlemanly, yet he could not compare to a sickly person like Cui
Buqu in Feng-Er’s eyes. Of course he felt unhappy about it.</p><p>He wanted to say something, but
Feng Xiao did not gave him that opportunity. He merely smiled and said “Let us
proceed.” Before bringing Cui Buqu inside.</p><p>Cui Buqu was half-dragged,
half-pulled into the hall. On the outside, Feng Xiao looked very intimate and lovely,
but in truth he didn’t allow him the chance to revolt.</p><p>The Linlang Alliance’s Auction Hall
has two floors shaped like a patio. In the centre is where the auction will be
taking place and around it were tables and chairs for its bidders. From the
second floor, one could glance down and see everything that is happening in the
centre. Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu’s seats were in south of the second floor. In
the morning, there were already a few dumplings and tea. The employees also did
not yelped and talk loudly as usual. Even when they walked, their footsteps
were silent. Following their example, the guest themselves also spoke softly.
The melody of lute filled the hall, creating a soothing rhyme. It did not seem
like the usual way Linlang Alliance would conduct business. It was as if one
has entered a pub. </p><p>Cui Buqu roughly scanned the place
with his eyes. He realized that at most, those who sat on the first floor are
normal businessmen and pugilists, on the second floor were either relatives of
the Emperor or sons of officials of the imperial court. Comparing the quietness
on the second floor, the first floor is far more rowdy. The reason the Linlang
Alliance separated the two floors was because they were trying to avoid
unnecessary troubles.</p><p>Just as they walked up the stairs
and took a turn, entering behind the screen and completely out of Lin Wei’s
line of sight, Feng Xiao almost immediately released his hand, practically
shoving Cui Buqu to the side, as if he’s afraid if he continue touching him for
a moment longer, some sort of dust would cling into him.</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>He quietly gave Feng Xiao another strike
in his book before sitting down expressionlessly.</p><p>Feng Xiao acted as if he felt
nothing, laughing, “Judging by your look, I wager you know of Lin Wei’s queer
habits?”</p><p>Cui Buqu was displeased, “This is
the reason you used me to make a fool of him? Does our agreement include this
sort of arrangement?”</p><p>Feng Xiao faked a look of
innocence, “Regardless, I brought you to here to witness a rare sight today, as
compensation, it hurts not for you to sacrifice a little. With me present, he
would not be able to do anything to you.”</p><p>Cui 
Buqu responded blandly, “Although Lin Wei is absurb, he is no fool.
Using me as your excuse, would not using Pei Jingzhe be more convincing?” </p><p>Pei Jingzhe who had been quietly
drinking his tea coughed suddenly.</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, “Impossible. He
is not as good looking as you are.”</p><p>As his voice dies down, Lin Wei’s
shadow emerged from behind the screen.</p><p>“How rowdy is the floor below, it
makes one unable to attain a moment of quietness. Feng-Er Lang, you wouldn’t
mind if I came here?”</p><p>There was only a foot of distance
between Feng Xiao and Cui Buqu, but the moment Lin Wei’s voice sounded, Feng
Xiao grabbed Cui Buqu’s wrist at the speed of light, the upper half of his body
leaned down towards him, and spoke in a very intimate voice, “QuQu, there is
dust on your nose. Come, allow me to wipe it away for you.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>Lin Wei glared at Cui Buqu with a
gaze that looked as if it would burn. Cui Buqu obviously caught his glare and
killing intent, but the other quickly withdrew his gaze, as if nothing out of
the ordinary had happened.</p><p>In the Jianghu province, although
the Yandang Estate was only a moderately ranked family, but because of Lin Leng’s
open personality, everyone would tolerate him and gave him some face when they
were conversing with Lu Wei. However, when it came to Feng Xiao, this was
practically useless.</p><p>“My apologies, I fear there is no
space on my table left.” Feng Xiao smiled, but his refusal was straightforward
and clear.</p><p>Lin Wei refused to bulge. He looked
as if he wanted to say something, but Pei Jingzhe immediately interrupted, “Young
Master Lin, this way.”</p><p>“Then we may converse at a later
time.” Lin Wei could only leave.</p><p> Feng Xiao was smiling daggers.</p><p>He gave no face to Lin Wei, but Lin
Wei did not even show his displeasure. To Lin Wei, Feng Xiao is like a mysterious,
grand, and otherworldly figure. He was unable to find out his name or
background. He came and went like a shadow that was untraceable. With this
trait alone, it was enough to make Lin Wei faint, otherwise, he would not have
unable to forget him until this moment.</p><p>Before he left, Lin Wei could not
help but looked at Cui Buqu again. The latter’s hand is still held by Feng
Xiao, his eyebrows were low. It was difficult to tell what he was thinking
about.</p><p>He gave a faint smile, as if he
thinks that Cui Buqu was merely a temporary plaything for Feng Xiao, flipped
his sleeves and left.</p><p>After Feng Xiao’s fingers let go of
his wrist, Cui Buqu did not show the displeasure he’d showed just now, in fact
he was deep in thought.</p><p>With Feng Xiao’s position as the
Second Commandant of the House of Blades, there was no need for Feng Xiao to be
so concerned about Lin Wei’s feelings. He definitely did not need to use Cui
Buqu as a defensive mechanism. Even though Lin Wei kept coming and harassing him,
Feng Xiao seemed as though he has no intentions of cutting off his ties with
Lin Wei. This act alone deserved its own reason.</p><p>“What are you thinking? Want me to
help you ease your worries?” Feng Xiao’s voice rang in his ears. </p><p>Cui Buqu thought of one
possibility, “Is the House of Blades investigating Lin Wei in secret?”</p><p>Feng Xiao blinked &nbsp;in surprise, “What makes you think that?”<br>
　　<br>
Cui Buqu did not response, he thought instead: <i>Could it be that Lin Wei is related to the Khotan ambassador’s case?
No, that’s definitely not right. The Yandang Estate is a thousand miles from
the City of Six Crafts, on usual days, the Khotan kingdom also did not have
much to do with the Linlang Alliance. The reason Lin Wei came here was
definitely for the crowd. However, among the things the Lin family sold, a type
of silk called the ‘Sky Blanket’. It was manufactured in the South, and had
colours like the colour of daylight. That silk is like glass and is well
received by its customers. It soon became a tribute. Every year, the Lin family
would provide the silk to the palace. According to rumours, it’s said that they
wanted to get close to the Crown Prince through this fact.</i></p><p>Feng Xiao allowed him to think
whatever he wanted, but he said leisurely, “QuQu, it is such a waste for a man
of your capabilities to be a small nobody in the Zuoyue Alliance. If you are
willing, there are now three commandants in the House of Blades, I could offer
a reference, and make you the forth commandant of the house.”</p><p>From the side, Pei Jingzhe opened
his eyes wide. As if he wanted to say something, but refrained from doing so.</p><p>The House of Blades held power that
surpassed even the six ministries, additionally, Feng Xiao also has the
privilege of making decisions without needing an approval from the imperial
court. Although Cui Buqu is very likely a member of the Zuoyue Alliance, as of
now they’re still unsure. For his lord to offer the forth commandant of the
House of Blades like this, can it not be bewildering? For a moment, Pei Jingzhe
could not tell whether Feng Xiao was genuinely recruiting talents, or he was
simply testing Cui Buqu.</p><p>Cui Buqu was expressionless,
raising his head, “Zuoyue Alliance, why is it that I understood nothing of what
you are talking about?”</p><p>Feng Xiao held his hand, “Your body
is fragile. It is unbearable for you to run around the city like that,
strategize your next moves, and yet no one cared. I felt pity for you. The
House of Blades needs someone with your intelligence and sharpness. If you
would only nod, I will deal with the Zuoyue Alliance myself and guarantee your
transfer. What says you?”</p><p>He used a very serious gaze on Cui
Buqu, sincerity all over his smile. It’s as if dead trees would blossom, and
pebbles would weep at the sight.</p><p>This was the first time Cui Buqu
has met someone who could lie so convincingly by simply using a handsome face.
It was enough to make one faint, drop everything they were thinking about.
Although Cui Buqu was not seduced, it was impossible for him to not admire the
beautiful sight before him.</p><p>“Lord Feng, although your words are
very convincing, I am not certain what you are talking about. I am only
interested in being a Taoist. After this is through, I beseech you to keep your
promise and let me go.”</p><p>Since his seduction failed, Feng
Xiao smiled and released his hand, leaning back and returning to his normal
posture. </p><p>“Since when did I promise to let
you do? That time, I said I was willing to consider it, but whether you can
convince me or not, that is up to your performance.”</p><p>Even though a playful, douchebag
look from Feng Xiao was also very attractive, but Cui Buqu could not help but
call him <i>despicable</i> in his head. </p><p>Just as the two of them were
bantering, a clear sound ran across the halls. A young man walked to the centre
of the hall and sounded the bell.</p><p>Everyone present immediately turned
their gaze towards him.</p><p>

The real show is about to begin.
