<br><h2>Chapter 14 – Do You Want To See My Most ‘Invaluable Treasure’? </h2><br><br>

<p>Ever since the Linlang Alliance
became famous, many businesses also copied its methods, creating auctioning
events. However, when compared, the Linlang Alliance was still the grandest.
Every year, the Linlang Alliance only needed to issue invitations, it would be
received as something even more invaluable than gold, many people would view
the invitation as an identity significance, and take it to attend the auction
with pride.</p><p>If Feng Xiao wanted an invitation.
He needn’t flaunt his title in order to get one. However, it wasn’t so easy for
others. </p><p>“Today is the last day of the
auction. We thank everyone who took your time to attend, this is the pride and
honour of the Linlang Alliance to receive you. Let us not waste time bantering,
we know that everyone is both eager and excited to begin. Let us bring the
first item forward, everyone please be patient.”</p><p>A middle-aged man did not care to
hold his voice as he shouted in a deep rumbling voice, his voice spreading
across the place. This man was surely be a martial artists with high
capabilities. However, at a glance, the Linlang Alliance is a powerful
business, naturally it would attract a lot of envious people. For them to
invite a few highly skilled martial artists here to sit around as bodyguards is
not strange at all.</p><p>Just as the orders were given, a
beautiful waitress brought a tray forward with two young waiters on her left
and right. Once the golden cloth is pulled away, a jade green copper wine vessel
was revealed before the audience’s eyes.</p><p>“This is the very same vessel used
by the Duke Han of Qi during the Spring Autumn period. On the vessel there are
inscriptions that could prove its authenticity. This item is brought to us by
our Lanling Alliance’s Master Dong Yang. The beginning price is ten guan. The
auction ends if there is no higher bidder after three calls. Please begin.”</p><p>The waitress move immediately,
ringing the bell, and immediately someone said, “Eleven guan!”</p><p>“Twelve guan!”</p><p>“Thirteen guan!”</p><p>Once the auction had begun, the
entire hall became rowdy. Not long after, someone called for thirty guan.</p><p>These people may not be too
interested in the wine vessel itself, but as long as the item is from the
Linlang Alliance, it was mostly valuable. Even if they did not want it
themselves, they could use it to gift others. They only need to say that it was
from the Linlang Alliance’s Master Dong Yang, it is enough to impress anyone.</p><p>“Who was the one who offered thirty
guan?” Feng Xiao asked Cui Buqu in deep interest.</p><p>He did not shout for a price.
Compared to the wine vessel, Feng Xiao was more interested in its bidders. He
knew that Cui Buqu would know this.</p><p>As he expected, Cui Buqu said, “The
other man’s name is called Leng Dou. He is the adopted son of the Canal
Transport Jiu Bang group’s leader. As of late, the leader, Ning Shewo, gifted a
beautiful woman to the Emperor of the Northern Dynasty, Chen Shubao. The woman
obtained the love and attention of Chen Shubao and became an important person
by his side. Because of this, Shubao might also be willing allow Ning Shewo to
conduct the business of all the canal transports in the south. The reason Leng
Dou bid for the item, is most likely because he wants to gift it as a tribute.
Except that Chen Shubao is an Emperor, he wouldn’t be interested in something
like this. So this present is mostly only for someone close to him, a servant
or attendant. If not mistaken, he is determined to get the item. Others would
not place such a heavy bid on only the first item.”</p><p>The Canal Transport Jiu Bang isn’t
only just a group, but it is formed from the merging of nine different groups.
They did business on water and are one of the indispensable forces in the
Southern Wulin that cannot be underestimated. Among the Jiu Bang groups, the
Jinhuan group has the largest power, thus the Jinhuan group’s leader, Ning
Shewo, became the leader of all nine groups.</p><p>It wasn’t a difficult task for the
House of Blades to investigate whoever they wanted to investigate, but it
wasn’t as convenient as having Cui Buqu by their side who knew all the worldly
matters of Wulin and Jianghu in his heart. With a few words, he would recite
the other person’s origins and background. This is an ability that Pei Jingzhe
wouldn’t even be able to manage. Only the Zuoyue Alliance can produce such a
talent.</p><p>After Cui Buqu finished talking,
the exchange was done. The wine vessel was bought by Leng Dou, completely
aligned with Cui Buqu’s prediction. </p><p>This person looked pale on the
surface, he also looked sickly with a large robe over him that practically covered
half his face. People who sat near him could also feel tiredness radiating from
him, but when he opened his mouth to speak, there was optimism in his voice. It
made one couldn’t help but admire it.</p><p>Feng Xiao clapped his hand and
complimented, “A-Cui, you are utterly brilliant! From all the guests before my
eyes, you’re the only one who got distinguished by thirty percent!”</p><p>Cui Buqu kept his mouth shut,
refusing to respond to him.</p><p>But Feng Xiao refused to let it go,
“Would you not ask where the other seventy percent went?”</p><p>Cui Buqu replied coldly, “There is
no need to ask in order for me to know.”</p><p>Feng Xiao laughed, “It seems you
also think the same way. Of all the heroism in the world, they are the same. I
have took seventy percent, so the remaining thirty percent is offered to you!”</p><p>Cui Buqu rolled his eyes as a
reply.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe asked in curiousity,
“Does Ning Shewo have any sons?”</p><p>Cui Buqu shook his head, “Ning
Shewo and his wife were married for nineteen years, but they were blessed with
no children except for an adopted son, Leng Dou. They treat him like one of
their own. Ning Shewo already spread word that he would be retiring next year,
if not mistaken, the position of the leader would be succeeded by Leng Dou.
However, Leng Dou is still young, he could not even dominate the Jinhuan group
yet. All has yet to be set in stone, there is still things to left observe.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe only knew a little of
it from the rumours, but he had smiled and dismissed them. Because he felt like
those related to the Jianghu province are matters concerning the South, and had
nothing whatsoever to do with the <b>Sui
Empire</b>. </p><p>It was as if Cui Buqu understood
what he was thinking, he replied blandly, “If the Emperor wants to cut down the
Chens, he would have to head down the Southern river. The Canal Transport Jiu
Bang group is indispensable in the South, therefore, if things can be done
within to avoid conflicts, when the time comes, the situation could not have
been worse than watching the Jiu Bang group allying with the Southern Dynasty
to go against the Sui Empire.”</p><p>Feng Xiao only smiled and remained
silent. He had long already thought of this matter.</p><p>But Pei Jingzhe hadn’t. Listening
to this, he was shocked and immediately clasped his hands together, “I
understand.”</p><p>At first when Cui Buqu started
coughing before he could even speak two sentences, although Pei Jingzhe had
never said it on the lips, he couldn’t help but look down on Cui Buqu. After all,
the House of Blades and the Zhuoyue Alliance is different from the Three
Departments and Six Ministries. The former two often travel across lands. The
knowledge of martial arts isn’t a must, but if they did not know how to defend
themselves, if they were ambushed by skilled martial artists, then it would
hinder their tasks. Cui Buqu is a special case. This person came from the Glass
Palace and knew the world of Jianghu like the back of his hands, yet he did not
even have a single ounce of martial arts on him. Although right now he was
under the control of Feng Xiao, the way he spoke did not show a hint of
cowardice or intention of giving in, he neither begged for his life either.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe felt that, this person,
even if he doesn’t know any martial arts, it is no huge problem. If his lord could
make his man work beneath him, then it is as though the House of Blades’ power
would increase dramatically.</p><p>The next one is two ancient
instruments. One is a zither called Green Dragonfly, the other is a famous
sword called White Rainbow.</p><p>Both are exemplary weapons.
Therefore, it’s natural that many people went out of their way to fight for
them. Even Feng Xiao seemed to be interested in the Green Dragonfly,
participating into the auction as well. However, in the end, someone bought it
with three thousand silver taels and bought the zither. Feng Xiao did not seem
that he felt like he needed to own it definitely, so he gave up midway.</p><p>Cui Buqu could tell that the other
obviously really wanted the zither, but gave up half-way, he could not help but
glared at him a few times. </p><p>Feng Xiao realized it, so he curled
up the corners of his lips, “I do not want the Green Dragonfly because I have
something that is even more invaluable. Do you want to see my most ‘invaluable
treasure’?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>Cui Buqu is not someone who fights
with words. If he wanted to, he can argue with the other and make his face
cease all form of light. Last time, when he was faced before someone despicable
like Feng Xiao, there was no need for him to open his mouth, someone else would
clean up these sort of people for him. However, as of now, trapped under the
banner of the other, he needed to make his move personally. He fixed his eyes
on the other, and spoke.</p><p>But since Cui Buqu isn’t a shy
lady, so there was no expectation for him to blush madly after hearing
something so suggestive. He only replied flatly and calmly, “Please bring it
out and enlighten me.”</p><p>Feng Xiao sniffed, “A-Qu, how could
you be so frivolous? A ‘holy’ item like this, can you not use the word ‘bring
it out’? It should be ‘presented’.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I am afraid that when
you bring out your ‘invaluable treasure’, in less than a minute it would shrink
to the size of a finger, then I will be very disappointed.”</p><p>Feng Xiao was shocked, “I am
speaking of a zither, were you not speaking of one?”</p><p>Cui Buqu laughed coldly, “I am also
speaking of a zither, how would you know I am not speaking of one?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>He could no longer tolerate
listening to these two talk, and could only raise a cup to his lips to hide his
twitching mouth.</p><p>Feng Xiao used a ‘<i>keep talking</i>’ look and glared at Cui
Buqu, “In that case, QuQu, what zither in this world could expand and shrink as
it pleases?”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “Tiangong Pavillion’s Li
Xuanji just made a fold-up zither. When it’s folded up, it is as big as a palm,
when it’s expanded, it is as big as a lute. Lord Feng, you are a member of the
House of Blades, yet you didn’t know of this?”</p><p>Feng Xiao smiled, “Li Xuanji
possessed god given haves, but my skills with the zither, is definitely better
than his, and better than the Green Dragonfly. Except the Green Dragonfly is a
famous zither, it is difficult to come across. If I can have it for a few days,
it would be excellent.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “The one who bought the
Green Dragonfly is called Cui Hao. He is the eldest son of the second wife of
the leader of Boling Cui Sect. Next month on the eighth day, it would be his
father, Cui Yong’s birthday. Cui Yong loved the zither like life itself, and he
also loved Cui Hao.”</p><p>Judging by his meaning, this zither
was bought as a gift for his father.</p><p>The rest of the auctioned items
were all purchased as well.</p><p>Those who are able to attend the
Linlang Alliance’s auctioning event are naturally people who had no money
problems. When they brought something away, it could alleviate their position
and significance, creating an illusion of someone at a higher place. &nbsp;So no matter how expensive the items were,
there is bound to be someone who bought it. However, some of the participants
were not people even Feng Xiao or Pei Jingzhe knew, yet Cui Buqu could recite
their background one by one. From his introduction of them, Feng Xiao vaguely
knew that they had nothing to do with the case.</p><p>When it day drifted towards the
afternoon, half the auction was already through. The Linlang Alliance served
its customers with a variety of desserts, so they could fill their stomachs
with something. The people were not too hungry, instead they were excited for
the next half of the auctioning event.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe could no longer sit for
another moment. He suspected that the Jade of Heaven’s Lake might not even
appear here, however, Feng Xiao seemed as though he intended to go with his
decision, so Pei Jingzhe could only sit properly back.</p><p>After a while, he heard a young man
said, “The next item is a jade stone, it has no name nor origin. It only
arrived here yesterday and given to Linlang Alliance. It has not gotten through
Master Dong Yang’s approval, so it’s impossible to determine whether it’s
genuine or a bogus item. This sort of thing, if it is bought by the customer
and regretted, the Linlang Alliance will not take any form of responsibility. Just
as a notice.”</p><p>This rule was already spoken once,
but was repeated again. People who originally weren’t too interested looked
discouraged.</p><p>The waiter brought chest with
cravings and took out the item inside. From outside the window, sunlight shone
through. Everyone gasped in wonderment. </p><p>Pei Jingzhe also practically
couldn’t sit still. He immediately straightened his body and glared at the item
in the waitress’ hands.</p><p>It’s the Jade of Heaven’s Lake!<br>
<br>
</p><p><b>Sui Empire: </b></p><p>The Sui Dynasty will now be called the Sui Empire
to avoid confusion with the Northern and Southern Dynasties.</p>
