</p><h2>Chapter 22 – You Are Not Lying Enough Convincingly</h2><br><br>
<p>The
man in white looked a little taken aback.</p><p>From
the way he saw it, Fo Er’s determination and skills, even if it was not
sufficient to kill Feng Xiao tonight, it was still enough to hold him down. Who
knew that the number one fighter of Turk was only an empty name. It hasn’t even
been two hours, and Feng Xiao had already caught up.</p><p>“Lord
Feng, your martial arts are par excellence, but still you have surpassed by
expectations.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “It was never your intention to go far in the first place. Tonight, of
all the people that came, your background is a mystery. Would you not consider
introducing yourself before you leave?”</p><p>The
man in white, “Names are but only something to be called by. After a hundred
years, all returns to dust and earth. Lord Feng, there is no reason for you to
be so persistent.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “The more people speak that way, the more they care about dignity. You
wear white all over, but inside you are undoubtedly someone incredibly picky to
both others and yourself. How would you be similar to the elegance and grace
that you showed on the outside?”</p><p>The
man in white, “I am not interested in your judgement of my character. What I am
interested in is, that you have poisoned Master Cui and imprisoned him by your
side, yet why is it that he still hopes for your rescue? Could it be possible
that there are people in this world who enjoys being tortured?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu responded coldly, “I do not like to be tortured, but I know that, I am
better off in Feng Xiao’s hands compared to yours.”</p><p>The
man in white felt strange, “Other than I was rough when I took you away, since
when have I not treated you with care?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “When he does things, he knows his boundaries and his goals, yet as for
you, you do not value the lives of others.”</p><p>“QuQu,
it’s so rare to hear you complimenting me in front of others, my heart, truly,
is shocked—“</p><p>When
the world ‘truly’ was spoken, Feng Xiao’s shadow immediately disappeared,
dashing towards them.</p><p>The
man in white’s reflexes were quick. He quickly held Cui Buqu and moved
backwards, going as far push Cui Buqu in front slightly, intending to use him
to block Feng Xiao’s attacks any time soon.</p><p>Who
knew that Feng Xiao had no intention to hit his vital spots in the first place,
instead, he extends his hand and swept the top of his head.</p><p>The
man in white was taken by surprise. He could not hold his hat even if he wanted
to when it flew off. His head was bare, cold winds surging above it.</p><p>Cui
Buqu coughed twice, not caring to veil his laugh.</p><p>Feng
Xiao laughed even louder than him. “It would seem even monks nowadays are so
dishonest. Instead of staying in their temples, they came here to fight for a
jade. Who is your master? Let me enlighten him with the ways of Daoism!”</p><p>The
moon reflected its light on the man in white’s bald, shiny head. Feng Xiao
could not help but thought of an egg, especially hard boiled eggs without its
shell.</p><p>As
Cui Buqu coughed, Feng Xiao cast him a glance and realized that Cui Buqu was
actually trying to hide his giggle. He couldn’t help feeling that this sickly
man and him were actually quite in sync.</p><p>Upon
being exposed, an angry look flashed across the face of the man in white, but
it was very quickly replaced with calmness.</p><p>“I
am a wanderer with no master or host.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao responded with an ‘Oh’, “So you are but a wild monk, then you cannot call
yourself a man of the cloth. Who knew whether or not you are faking your
identity as a monk. I am of mind I have bring you back for questioning!”</p><p>As
he spoke he reached out to grab the man in white, yet the latter was incredibly
cautious. He moved backwards the distance of about ten steps or more the moment
the other opened his mouth.</p><p>But
Feng Xiao did not stop, he leaped into the air, seemingly not willing to give
up unless he had caught the man.</p><p>The
man in white furrowed his brows. He was not opposed to fighting with Feng Xiao,
but he did not want to waste his time, and he was even more unwilling to use
his skills in case he was recognized, so he was relentless and pushed Cui Buqu
forwards into Feng Xiao, before leaping into the air and intended to leave.</p><p>Who
knew that in that moment, a black shadow descended from the sky, his sword was
long and clanking, drifting towards him.</p><p>The
moonlight is bright tonight, and the clouds are faint, it was enough for the
man in white to see his face.</p><p>It
was the man whom was held hostage by Gao Ning just now, Pei Jingzhe!</p><p>Feng
Xiao alone is already difficult enough to fight, now there is another Pei
Jingzhe that joined the battle. Even if the latter is not strong enough for him
to consider an opponent, having a fly constantly buzzing by your ear and being
an annoyance is enough. The man in white knew that today, he definitely
wouldn’t be able to take something back to his master. Just as he avoided the
sword, using a branch as his stepping stone, he bounced off onto the roof and
left. Pei Jingzhe wanted to chase him, but he was already gone.</p><p>“Let
him go.” Feng Xiao said.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe descended from the tree and said guiltily, “My apologies, it was my
mistake that Gao Ning was not captured.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “His martial arts are above you. The fact that you can escape from him is
already saving me the trouble of saving you, in fact, I should be thanking
you.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe could not tell whether his lord was praising him or ridiculing him, but
after a while, he responded, “I… I… thank my lord for your praise?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “He is ridiculing you. Did you think he was praising you?”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “This kid is a little silly, my apologies.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I am used to it.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe kept his mouth shut and twitched, but he still asked, “My Lord, that
monk just now, do you need us to investigate his identity?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao turned towards Cui Buqu, “Master Cui should already know who he is.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I have my guess, but I do not know if it is him.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Speak and let us see.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “The Monk, Yu Xiu.”</p><p>Who
is that?</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe felt a little lost, in his mind, he searched for that name, but he knew
no one from Jianghu that went by that alias.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “This is a master of intellect. He seldom roams the Jianghu, so he is not
considered a man of Jianghu. Most of the time, he serves royalty, remaining
behind to strategize and devise plans.”</p><p>As
he heard the two words ‘royalty’, Pei Jingzhe felt as if something clicked in
him, but he dare not open his mouth to ask.</p><p>But
Feng Xiao had already said, “Prince Jin.”</p><p>It
is not a question, it is an answer.</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “That is correct.”</p><p>The
Prince Jin, Yang Guang, is the second son of the current Emperor. He and the
Crown Prince Yang Yong shared the same mother: Empress Dugu, but he was even
more bubbly and proactive than the Crown Prince. Like children who cried would
often be given candy, compared to his elder brother who was silent, Yan Guang
earned his parent’s favour more than his brother. This is no secret among the
imperial court.</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe had even heard that the Emperor intended to unite the Northern and
Southern dynasty and were appointing capable men to be its Commander. The
Empress held the intention of making Prince Jin the second in command,
following the first in command in this journey. If this fell into his hands,
who would still dare to say that the Prince Jin, who was spoiled rotten by the
Emperor and Empress when he was young, was only a naughty child? Prince Jin
would only be accumulating his conquests on the battlefield, surpassing even
the Crown Prince.</p><p>For
a strategist for someone like this, Yu Xiu would naturally become a future
minister of the country. &nbsp;</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe inhaled a breath.</p><p>He
wasn’t afraid of Yu Xiu, but the man behind Yu Xiu.</p><p>“As
someone of Prince Jin’s house, did he not know about the House of Blades? Why
would he send someone to do shady work?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “Naturally, it’s because he wants the jade.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “He took it for…. For his master, Prince Jin?”</p><p>Feng
Xiao responded with an ‘En’, “This time the loss of the jade is because the
House of Blades has failed its duty. Whoever can lay their hands on the Jade,
then who is the one with the achievement in the Emperor and Empress’ eyes. The
reason Prince Jin wanted to interfere is not strange at all. Even Master Cui’s
Zuoyue Alliance also couldn’t resist it and had to interfere, is that not?”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “I have no idea what you are saying.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao, “You are not lying enough convincingly.”</p><p>Cui
Buqu, “Then I’ll act better next time.”</p><p>As
he said, he made a slightly shocked expression, “What are you saying? What
Zuoyue Alliance, I don’t understand.”</p><p>Feng
Xiao nodded his head, “Your tone is still out of place, but your expression is
better now.”</p><p>Pei
Jingzhe, “……”</p><p>Suddenly,
there was a sound that broke the awkward silence.</p><p>

Cui Buqu suddenly said, “I’m hungry.”
