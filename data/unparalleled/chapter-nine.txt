<br><h2>Chapter 9 – You Motherfucker You Wouldn’t Even Let Me Eat, And You Want Me To Work For You?</h2><br><br>
<p>The word ‘Zuo’
and ‘Yue’ forms part of the Chinese character ‘Sui’. Therefore, it’s natural
that it has something to do with the Sui Dynasty.</p><p>After Yang Jian
succeeded the throne, made the title he used to owned as the governor of the
county, and named the era ‘Kaihuang’. On the second year of the Kaihuang era,
after the House of Blades was established for half a year, another alliance by
the name of ‘Zuoyue’ appeared. </p><p>They are
similar to the House of Blades and wields a power outside of the Three
Departments and Six Ministries, however, they were not under the orders of the
Emperor. They were under orders of the Empress. </p><p>This Empress
who contributed to the country, as well as shared the burdens with the Emperor,
who was loved and respected: Empress Dugu. She made something her predecessor
never did, that is to establish a system to work under her orders.</p><p>Sometimes
called Her Holiness, this is not simply an empty name. The power Empress Dugu
held surpassed any previous Empress before her time, including Empress Lu. What
made her different from Empress Lu is that Yan Jian both feared and respected
this Empress.</p><p>Ever since the
establishment of the Zuoyue Alliance, their power was no less than the House of
Blades. Their mission was the same: trading and sending coded messages across
the Northern and Southern Dynasty. There were no restrictions for them.
However, since both Emperor and Empress were loving and respectful of each
other, Empress Dugu knew her place and would not surpass the Emperor’s
authority. So she gave the Zuoyue Alliance a duty that was slightly different:
that they will take care of anything related to the pugilist world. </p><p>The Zuoyue
Alliance has one Leader, two Vice-Leaders. Their ranks were fewer and thinner,
but they carry out their tasks in secrecy, often not appearing in front of the
public eye. Even the most trusted advisors of the Emperor only knew of the
Zuoyue Alliance’s name, yet did not know who were its members, nor what they
were doing.</p><p>However, during
the course of their missions, sometimes they would clash with the House of
Blades. Although they had no animosity with each other, and belonged
respectively to the Emperor and Empress, they often wanted to fight for the
achievement of claiming the glory.</p><p>Because of a
few cases in the past, Pei Jingzhe crossed paths with the Zuoyue Alliance, he
knew how difficult it is to determine who they were.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
worked under the House of Blades, so he knew a little about the Zuoyue
Alliance. He never saw the alliance’s leader, but he saw both its vice-leaders.
One was delicate and silm, like a wealthy man’s daughter, one was silent and
quiet, like a monk in mediation. Although the House of Blades and the Zuoyue
Alliance are agencies hiding incredibly skilled people, but people like those
two vice-leaders were rare to see in a place like this.</p><p>And so the
leader of the alliance that never showed himself. Pei Jingzhe never saw him
with his own two eyes, but regardless, it was difficult to link him with a
sickly man like Cui Buqu.</p><p>Women may be
skilled in the martial arts. And quiet people may be capable of claim one’s
life with only a single move. However, this Cui Buqu who could not even pick a
fight, could he have been a spy of the Zuoyue Alliance? Because his health
isn’t good, and that he used the identity of a Taoist to back himself up, it
would be convenient for him to lay low?</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
thought and thought, “You’re thinking that the Zuoyue Alliance placed spies
among those who attended the Linlang Alliance’s auction, where all the
pugilists would gather? If he really is someone from the Zuoyue Alliance and
knew that we are people from the House of Blades, why did he not say so?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “The
old Zixia Taoist Temple might be allying with Qin Miaoyu, but this man only
came to the Zixia Taoist Temple two months ago. Four to five years were in
between the time of his arrival and when Qin Miaoyu left the City of Six
Crafts. I have never thought he was related to the case, but two months prior
to now, the imperial court seems to be determined move against the Turks.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
said suddenly, “So, since the beginning, you just wanted to find out what is
his background? If he really is from the Zuoyue Alliance, did we not just made
enemies out of our own people?”</p><p>Although both
agencies often bickered, they were still subjects of the crown and the imperial
court. To go all out like this towards one of their own, surely that is not a
wise course of action?</p><p>Feng Xiao
looked indifferent, “If we became enemies, then so be it. There is more than a
handful of those that hate me. Adding him into that category does not affect
the situation much. Did you think that they weren’t thinking of getting
involved in this case of the Khotan ambassador’s murder?”</p><p>Although their
existence were faint, but they have eyes and ear spread out all over Beijing
and was updated with all kinds of news and happenings that were going on. </p><p>A few days ago,
the Emperor and his officially has just moved in to the new capital, Daxing
City, and before that, the citizens have already moved into it. The old capital
has been there for many generations and became incredibly stuffy, when it
rained, drains and sewers were flooded everywhere. So after Yang Jian ascended
the throne, he ordered the old capital to be set aside for a new one to be
built. Not two years later, the new capital was built. The Sui Emperor made
orders that the books which have been forgotten and scattered due to the war,
to be recollected and relocated in the imperial library, so that they would not
be lost again.</p><p>These actions
were noble and modest as expected of an exemplary ruler. Right now, Emperor
Yang Jian decided to push his forced towards the Turks to solve the issue once
and for all. Nobody would question the determination of the Emperor. The Three
Departments and Six Ministries immediately got busy, bringing both the House of
Blades and the Zhuoyue Alliance, both of them received respective orders and
began working. Whoever could achieve the most conquests in this mission, then
they would be the ultimate winner. The Zuoyue Alliance had always wanted to
surpass the House of Blades, so of course they wouldn’t have let such an
opportunity to slip by.</p><p>Cui Buqu
stirred in his dreams and coughs a few times.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
looked at him. Before this, he didn’t know that he might be a member of the
Zuoyue Alliance, so he didn’t feel anything, but right now, he couldn’t help
but feel a bit of sympathy.</p><p>“Then, should I
neutralize the poison in his body?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
looked at him like he was the stupidest person in the world, “Why should you?
If he refuse to admit anything, this would a good opportunity to make him work
with us. Even if he admits it, you should keep pressing that it’s a lie so he
would do our bidding. In the City of Six Crafts, whatever I say is the law.”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
twitched his lip and nodded.</p><p>He knew that
his master isn’t someone who is soft and emphatic. </p><p>…..</p><p>Just as Feng
Xiao and Pei Jingzhe were discussing Cui Buqu right before himself, the one who
laid on the bed in pain and agony had no idea what was going on.</p><p>Cui Buqu had
been walking on a very long road, and this road was endless. However, this road
would sometimes grow thorns so he would quickly withdraw his legs. He wanted to
continue walking forwards, even if he had to bend down to pluck those thorns
away with his hands. However, even when both his hands are stained with blood,
those thorns did not grow lesser, instead, it had multiplied. </p><p>Those thorn
hurt to the bone and left deep scars. His mind reflected all kinds of pain, but
Cui Buqu continues pulling away those thorns with an expressionless face.</p><p>Since he was
little, whatever he wanted to do, he would achieve it no matter the price, no
matter how difficult it is. Nothing could stop him. If he wanted to move
forward, he would move forward to see what is at the end. </p><p>Those thorns
couldn’t hinder him, and after that, it wilted and faded away. Cui Buqu did not
stare at his bloody hands, because before him, a grand mansion had appeared.</p><p>This mansion
possessed a history that went back to thousands of years.</p><p>Before the Sui
Dynasty established its rule, the Northern Dynasty was in a mess, yet the
mansion’s owner was unyielding. Its house blossomed and thrived, and became a
place no one was able to forget.</p><p>Cui Buqu
finally stopped walking.</p><p>The doors of
the mansion was locked, but atop the stage, two people stood. One has long
white had and looked very serious, the other had short hair and looked much
younger. In his hands, he carried a baby wrapped up in a blanket, he told the
old man.</p><p>“Father,
please, give him a name!” The young man said.</p><p>The old man
responded coldly, “Whatever—<b>A-Da</b> or <b>A-Er</b> would be fine. Then be
over with it.”</p><p>The young man
begged, “Considering that both his parents had died, couldn’t you spare some
sympathy?”</p><p>The old man,
“He is weak and I fear he might not even survive for the next feel days, so
what if he has a name?”</p><p>The young man,
“…even if it’s true, in the future, wouldn’t it be part of a memory?”</p><p>The old man
snorted, “Since his parents are dead, who will remember him in this world?”</p><p>The young man,
“I would.”</p><p>As the two
spoke for a long time, the old man finally said, “Let us name him something
simple, like a stepping stone—something that everyone steps on. It would be
easy to raise him like this.”</p><p>“What about the
genealogy—“ </p><p>“He is not
worthy.”</p><p>He is not
worthy.</p><p>These three
words had always been in Cui Buqu’s mind, refusing to leave, repeating itself
in his mind like clouds and mist.</p><p>Cui Buqu
laughed bitterly.</p><p>His laugh
startled the old man and the young man. They turned, but the fog thickens and
spreads around them.</p><p>Everything
turned dark.</p><p>The abyss was
hidden within peace, and had never left, but after so many years, he had
already walked into a place even more dangerous than the abyss</p><p>His chest
radiated a sharp pain, blood gathered at his throat. He wanted to laugh, but
he’d only let out a bitter, raw taste in his mouth.</p><p>Then, he woke
up.</p><p>Through puffed
up eyelids, even a little bit of sunlight could cause his eyes to water. Cui
Buqu adjusted for a while, before he could clearly see the gauze blanket in
front of him.</p><p>It was replaced
by a face that was handsome and beautiful, moving into his vanity.</p><p>“You woke up.”
Feng Xiao looked at him, “How do you feel?”</p><p>Cui Buqu was
too lazy to reply to him, so he closed his eyes and rested.</p><p>Feng Xiao
continues talking to himself, “You have the Naihe drug in your body, earlier
on, the poison took effect. In two days, it will take affect again, if you
would work alongside with me and cooperate, I can consider neutralizing the
poison for you. What says you?”</p><p>Cui Buqu blinks
slowly and answered with a hoarse voice, “Do I have a choice to refuse?”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“No.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I
have no knowledge of martial arts. There is nothing much I can help you.”</p><p>Feng Xiao hums,
“Do you not hail from the Glass Palace of Fangzhang province? I’ve heard that
people born from that place are knowledgeable about all things in the world.
For the Lanling Alliance’s auction, I need such a man. You can assist me in
recognizing everyone on the way, tell me who everyone and anyone is.”</p><p>Cui Buqu went
silent for a moment, “No problem. However, I have a request.”</p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Neutralizing the poison is not a valid request.”</p><p>Cui Buqu
coughed, “……I am hungry. You motherfucker, you wouldn’t even let me eat and you
want me to do something for you?”</p><p>He glared at
the bowl of white congee and a plate of fermented vegetables, practically
unable to control the look on his face.</p><p>Feng Xiao was
looked at him from one side “lovingly”, “Please eat, why aren’t you eating?”</p><p>Cui Buqu,
“Although I am a prisoner in your eyes and am free to let you do as you please,
but in the end you needed my help. I have yet to recover from my illness, and
you want me to eat these?”</p><p>Feng Xiao asked
curiously, “What’s not good about this? You know you couldn’t eat anything
heavy. I’m afraid you might have digestion issues, then you wouldn’t be able to
wake up tomorrow.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “I
don’t want any exquisite dishes, I only want fresh vegetables soup. Surely you
have something like that?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “My
apologies. I am a poor man, so there is none.”</p><p>Cui Buqu, “……”</p><p>He really
wanted to pour this bowl of congee on top of the other man’s head, and slap his
plate of vegetables into his face. </p><p>He’s not sure
what Feng Xiao is thinking about, but it’s definitely nothing good. He isn’t in
a hurry, and he didn’t want to leave, he might even think that Cui Buqu is very
interesting, not afraid that he’d provoke Cui Buqu. He wanted here and there,
looking at the windows and flowers, turning the books on bookcases around and
around, as if he’s waiting for Cui Buqu to slam the table and exclaim that he
was from the Zuoyue Alliance.</p><p>However, after
a long time, Cui Buqu said nothing. He simply took the bowl silently and drank
all the congee down his throat.</p><p>Feng Xiao knew
that he wouldn’t have chosen the wrong person. This Master Cui had a fairly
tame temper. The last time they met, he proclaimed himself innocent and hid a
lot of secrets from him. He only couldn’t believe that despite having and weak
and fragile body, the Naihe drug had been unable to do anything to him.</p><p>A man such as
this, even without the skills of martial arts, could have held an important
position in the Zuoyue Alliance. </p><p>Feng Xiao grew
even more interested.</p><p>Cui Daozhang
swallows carefully. He used an entire hour to finish the congee. Feng Xiao was
patient with him, waiting at his side until he puts down the bowl.</p><p>“May I ask what
is expected of me, my lord?”</p><p>Feng Xiao, “No
need to be so formal. I’ve already relayed my name to you. I am the second
among my siblings, you can call me <b>Feng-Er</b> or <b>Er Lang</b>.” </p><p>Cui Buqu did
not care respond, he answered, “I have been in the City of Six Crafts for two
months. I’ve heard of a few things. However, if you wanted me to assist you in
the Linlang Aliance’s auction, surely you need to tell me a few things first?”</p><p>Feng Xiao
smiled, “That is a given.”</p><p>After obtaining
Feng Xiao’s approval, Pei Jingzhe told Cui Buqu everything about the Khotan
ambassador’s murder, discovered by a travelling merchant, who fled to the city
to report his discovery.”</p><p>Cui Buqu
listened closely. After Pei Jingzhe finished talking, he asked, “Then, the plum
blossom scent in the horse carriage. Was it investigated?”</p><p>“Yes.” Pei
Jingzhe could not help but cast a glance towards Feng Xiao. He couldn’t but
think that these two followed the same trail of thoughts. Feng Xiao, too,
thought that the plum blossom was a crucial clue of the case, but the truth had
let them down.</p><p>“We’ve asked
every perfume stall in the city and checked everything in their stock. We could
not find the plum blossom perfume in the horse carriage, in the end. That
perfume….” Pei Jingzhe thought for a long moment before he managed to say
something, “It’s similar to the scent of the Naihe drug. As long as you smelled
it once, you will never mistake it for something else.”</p><p>After he said
finish only did he realize that something wasn’t right. Cui Buqu had just
experienced the Naihe drug’s torture. If he said something like this, wouldn’t
it be equivalent to pressing salt onto someone else’s wound?</p><p>However, Cui
Buqu showed no expression. He only nodded and coughed two times, then he didn’t
ask more.</p><p><b>A-Da</b> or <b>A-Er: </b>These are very common and ‘simply’ names. It means
‘A-big’ or ‘A-second’ like the eldest or second child. It indicates that the
old man was quite apathetic to the baby.</p><p><b>Feng-Er: </b>Feng as in Feng Xiao, and Er mean ‘Second’. This can mean that he
might have an older brother, thus he is named the ‘Second Feng’.</p><p><b>Er Lang:</b> Er here also means ‘second’, and Lang is
usually used to address a male.
