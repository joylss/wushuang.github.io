<br><h2>Chapter 3 – When He is Here, It is As If God Himself Is Here</h2><br><br>
<p>Opposite of the
Qiushan Residence, in the Northwest of the City of the Six Crafts, there is a
temple named Zixia Taoist Temple.</p><p>This temple was
built during the former dynasty, but when the old Master died, all the Taoist
of that temple fled. As years passed and no prayers or incense were offered,
people gradually forgets about it. For those who are young, they might not have
even heard of the name.</p><p>All was gloomy
until the new Master arrived.</p><p>On the third
day of the third month, it is the birthday of the deity Xuanwu.</p><p>On this day,
Zixia Taoist Temple was surrounded by visitors. Practically half of the entire
population in the city would gather here. Inside, everyone held three incense
sticks. On the outside, hawkers were selling various foods and fresh fruits for
those who came to pray.</p><p>Had it been two
months ago, nobody would have imagined that this abandoned temple may come back
to life, restoring to its former glorified and lively state. Nothing was even
refurnished. The statue remained the old statue, the most that was done
would’ve been simply changing some old tiles from the roof that was leaking
water when it rained and removing all the dead plants around the place.
However, to the local citizens, the smoke of joysticks was as thick as ever and
incense filled every corner of the temple. It seemed as though it grew holier
compared to last time.</p><p>It could be
said that these all happened only because of the succession of the new Master
in the temple.</p><p>A member of the
Zhang family was holding tightly to an oil lamp she’s just put on the altar. It
is difficult to move forward through a crowd, but all they wanted was to place
their own joysticks into the big incense burner in the temple and pray for the safety
of their family.</p><p>Despite the
fact that there were so many people, she never thought of retreating. Instead,
she blamed herself for coming late, and perhaps the gods above were displeased
with her behaviour. She told herself that after she had placed the joystick,
she would ask for a fortune, and best convince that little Taoist to ask the
master himself to read her fortune for her.</p><p>After an hour,
she finally managed to place her joystick and expressed her gratitude to the
gods and offer her tribute. At this time of the day, the sun is already high up
in the sky. The Zhang woman’s makeup was ruined by the steamy air within the
temple. Rowdy noises continue to surround her, shoulders brushing against one
another. A lot of people were similar to her—they never intended to back out,
in fact, they were excited, feeling as though they’ve accomplished a holy
achievement.</p><p>She lived in
the West of the city. Her husband owned two shops within the city. Her
situation was not bad, and her relationship with her husband is pretty good.
Only, they were unfortunate as they only bore a son when they were both in
their middle age. They treated their son like invaluable treasure, but who knew
that after two months, their son had a fever and almost passed away. Both husband
and wife visited every single temple and burned innumerable joysticks, yet it
was futile. Then they had heard of the peerless physician that became the new
Master of Zixia Taoist Temple. Even prayers from citizens who went to the
temple came true. She was desperate and did not care which doctor he invested
her money in, so she had rushed to his doorstep to ask for help. In the end,
her son was saved and from that day onwards, of the money she would usually
donate to the Jade Buddha Temple, she now donates to the Zixia Taoist Temple.<br>
　　<br>
The City of the Six Crafts is not a big city, so news of the Zhang
family’s son travelled at the speed of light. More and more people came to
Zixia Taoist Temple and within a single night, it became famous, matching with
the Jade Buddha Temple in terms of popularity and became the most famous temple
in the city.</p><p>She took out a
cloth to wipe her sweat. It wasn’t easy to squeeze into the temple, but she was
told that the Master would not be reading fortunes today, instead, he would be
in the courtyard relaying lore. The woman was illiterate, but because of her
trust in the Master Taoist, she still decided to attend his speech.</p><p>When she went
to the courtyard, she was shocked.</p><p>It was
practically filled with people, some were even standing outside. Yet they
weren’t creating a ruckus, only a few mutterings here and there, but their
voices were hushed.</p><p>From the
distance, she could finally see the Master Cui.</p><p>He was sitting
underneath an eave, his eyes smiling as he watched the crowd of people gathered
there. Madam Zhang was stunned. She remembered the Buddha statues in the
temple—his eyes shared the same look as those statues. The look of kindness and
gentleness. </p><p>Master Cui’s
complexion looked paler in comparison to the last time she saw him. It could
also be because that he was sitting outside in the open and it was the doing of
the sunlight. </p><p>Madam Zhang
came often to offer prays and once she heard that Master Cui’s health was not
actually in a prime state. However, as to why, no one could lay a finger on it.
As a woman who has no business with other men, she decided not to pry.</p><p>Even though
there is some distance between them, nobody was interrupting. So Master Cui’s
words were heard clearly throughout the hall.</p><p>He did not
sound sickly, only patient and gentle.</p><p>Just like a cup
of water that was either cold or hot and could hold the tea inside of it just
right, allowing its fragrance to fill the room.</p><p>When he’s here,
it’s as if God himself is here.</p><p>“The topic
today is about causality.” He said.</p><p>Everyone turned
to look at one another, their faces riddled with looks of doubt.</p><p>Master Cui
continues to smile as he spoke. “Most people might think that only Buddists
speak of causality, but Taoists like us also speak of causality. The book
‘Treaties of the Response of Tao’ speaks of Tao. It conveys the meaning that
regardless of a blessing or a curse, it was never fate or destiny. It is
related to you and your conduct. Kindness shall always be repaid in kind.” &nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t
matter whether she knew what he was saying at all. She had never so much
touched a book. Usually, the most she’d do was going to taverns to listen
storytellers speaking of life in the Pugilist world. But the talk of moral
principles of the world gave her a headache.</p><p>But right now,
it’s unknown whether it is because that so many people are listening together,
or because Master Cui is giving an excellent presentation. Not only did she
understand what he was saying, but she did not feel it was irritating. Instead,
she feels enlightenment in her heart.</p><p>“Let us use
Madam Zhang as an example.”</p><p>Hearing her
surname, she immediately paid attention. Initially, she thought that someone
else shared the same surname with her, but as she looks up, Master Cui was
looking at her, as well as the entire courtyard of people. </p><p>Her ears grew
red. She was never put in a position where she was the centre of attention, she
did not even know where to put her hands.</p><p>“A while ago,
Madam Zhang’s son was plagued by a heavy disease. It was practically incurable.
I believe everyone had heard of it. Had it not been for her usual kind deeds,
accumulating merit for the Zhang family, how would a terrible incident like
that ended so well?”</p><p>Madam Zhang had
never expected Master Cui would praise her so. She couldn’t help but blushed
madly. Even when she spoke, her voice was unstable, “My husband and I only
followed our hearts. We do not deserve such praise from Master Cui! When my son
is ill, it is all thanks to Master Cui’s brilliant skills. The Zhang family,
from top to bottom, will forever be grateful!”</p><p>Master Cui’s
smile deepened, “Such a brilliant ‘follow your heart’, you speak of it as if it
is so simple, and yet how many people in this world can achieve that? The
reason I came to Zixia Temple, if we should discuss about this fact at length,
haven’t I also received the guidance of numerous tutors?”</p><p>Everyone agreed
with him, once more impressing Madam Zhang. From doubt, she found envy.</p><p>Madam Zhang’s
face was red all over. For all the years she lived, this was the first someone
praised her for her kindness, and the one who praised her is a famed Taoist
from a famed temple. She could not wait to return home and share the story with
her husband. She decided in her heart, that the next time she visits Zixia
Taoist Temple, she would be offering more fragrant oil money. </p><p>From the corner
of her eye, Madam Zhang suddenly felt her eyes hurt. She had assumed it was
some gold or silver item that was reflecting the sunlight.</p><p>As she gathered
her focus, she realize it’s something flying across, like a bird flapping its
wings.</p><p>Madam Zhang
could not help but blinked, and she saw a grey shadow lunging itself at Master
Cui, a long sword in his hands as if he wanted to kill Master Cui with a single
blow!</p><p>The sword was
only half an inch away from his heart. Even if the people standing around him
acted quickly, they could not have been in time to save him. Nevertheless, it
all happened so fast. Nearly no one was able to react.</p><p>Master Cui
leans backwards, but his actions helped little to thwart the assassin. In less
than a second, the sword would pierce his heart and turn him from a live man to
a corpse.</p><p>

Madam Zhan could not see any hope for Master
Cui. She was so frightened that she immediately screamed!</p>
