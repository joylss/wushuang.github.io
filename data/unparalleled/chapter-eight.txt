<br><h2>Chapter 8 – All The Sufferings In The World, To Him, Is Only Honing His Character</h2><br><br>
<p>The name Naihe
Xiang, once it is heard, it’s as if it brought out a thousand sufferings all at
once. The aroma smelled like early summer, clear and soothing, however, in
truth, it is a drug used to provoke a man into becoming unreasonable, a drug
that messed with the mind.</p><p>Its lethality
is not enough to claim a person’s life, but as the effects takes place when
it’s constantly inhaled into the body, the victim will be drowned within the
haze and become addicted. One day without the drug, their breath would be
ragged and their body would go weak, their minds would start having
hallucinations. Three days without the Naihe drug, and they would feel knives
in their bones. Five days without the Naihe drug, it can be said that they’re
due to an appointment with the afterlife.</p><p>So that is how
the Naihe drug got its name. </p><p>Cui Buqu waited
in that place of a void for wholly five days.</p><p>The other chose
an opportune moment. Whenever he was incredibly tired, bouncing between
consciousness and unconsciousness, only would they send him food and water.
When Cui Buqu regained his consciousness, once he reaches out he can feel his
food and water beside him.</p><p>He was only
given a little bit of food and water, just enough to keep him alive. However,
lack of food and water was not the worse torture, but the infinitely quietness
and of not knowing whether it was day or night.</p><p>After the
darkness, there were more darkness, and a void of eternal silence.</p><p>Cui Buqu could
only use four fingers to count the hours and make himself comfortable. He
recited Taoist scripts, from Confucianism to Taoism, then from Taoism to
Buddism, to expel all the dark thoughts from his head.</p><p>However, his
sense of hearing gradually grew better. Even if rats scampered around, or even
there’s water leaking somewhere, he could hear it as clear as the day. However,
he knew not that methods Feng Xiao had used to make this residence felt as if
it was abandoned. If it hadn’t been for constantly receiving meals, Cui Buqu
would have wonder if he was forgotten, too.，</p><p>A normal person
would not have been able to withstand a torture like this. Three to five days
would be enough to drive one mad, let alone half a month, and let alone the
fact that Cui Buqu possessed a weak body. Every time the season changed, he
would also fall ill. When the third day came, it is was obvious to him that
he’s beginning to be affected—his mind falling into a frenzy, his stomach hurt
from starvation, and his arms and legs are beginning to feel weak, his body
becoming cold. He knew that after this is over, he would fall ill again. He
stopped reciting Taoist scripts, using only his mind to keep himself sane.</p><p>Then, at this
moment, a sweet aroma drifted into the room.</p><p>It is as if
it’s both present there and not. It smelled like the lotus garden when he
visited Beijing a year back. Faint and sweet, clean and clear, and it smelled
like lotus.</p><p>After a while,
Beijing will become crowded. The rich and wealthy would &nbsp;decorate their homes to welcome important
guests. They loved keeping cooked lotus and white fungus in urns and store them
for at least half a day to be taken out once the guests arrive. First, the
guests would drink something warm to allow it to sit in their stomach, before
drinking a bowl of cooked lotus and white fungus soup. The warmness and flavour
would spread from their throats to their stomach and expel all the heaty energy
from their body.</p><p>Such a manner
of retreating guests was something Cui Buqu had gotten used to.</p><p>Cui Buqu
blinked widely. </p><p>From the moment
his eyes adjusted from the darkness back to the lightning.</p><p>The fragrance
is still there, but this time, it wasn’t a hallucination.</p><p>Amid the
darkness, his eyebrows twitched and he have a stiff laugh.</p><p>The Naihe drug.</p><p>Although this
drug is poisonous and terrifying, it was also difficult to find. It was
difficult to believe that Feng Xiao would using such a thing on him, what a
waste.</p><p>Within this
residence, he could neither leave and he couldn’t stop breathing either. He
could only act like a drug addict, inhaling the scent.</p><p>If one possess
excellent martial art skills, perhaps they would have manipulate their energy
and suppress their breathing for some time, but to Cui Buqu, the Naihe drug
would only escalate the process of breaking his body, making him to beg for
death.</p><p>It seems Feng
Xiao did not have the intention to kill him. He was only using the drug to get
honest answers from him. However, this is like using a surgery knife to kill a
cow.</p><p>However, the
members of the House of Blades would not have guessed that he was used to this
sort of scent. In fact, Cui Buqu had managed to live past ten days with the
drug. Even though during that time, he was basically half-dead, he still managed
to remain conscious and did not allow himself to be forced into the enemy’s
favour. Even his tutor at that time, Fan Wei, was shocked beyond words.
Although his body is incompatible to train any form of martial arts, he was
determined in his heart.</p><p>Although he was
incredibly smart, Fan Wei also knew that even though Cui Buqu had no knowledge
of martial arts, he was still capable of being above the world.</p><p>Some people
were not meant to live a normal life.</p><p>All the pain in
the world, to him, was only honing his character for his future.</p><p>When all the
soil is removed, the only that’s left would be gold.</p><p>Cui Buqu
continues to close his eyes.</p><p>The Lanling
Alliance’s auction is still ongoing. He refuse to believe that Feng Xiao would
be patient enough to wait for ten days before he would hurry back.</p><p>…..</p><p>“So what of
it?” Feng Xiao stares at Pei Jingzhe, who hasn’t utter a word since, and felt a
little impatient. </p><p>Lanling
Alliance’s auction had begun four days ago and would be going on for six days.
Tomorrow would be the final day and during the first few days, only rare
medicine and exquisite materials would be sold. Only on the last and final day,
they would bring out invaluable treasures. </p><p>Although these
few days everything was very crowded, and there were many successful barters,
many people filled their cargos as they returned home. However, a lot of people
also had their eyes on the last auction. Even though they might not be able to
afford them, they also wanted to see them for themselves so that their trips were
not in vain.</p><p>However, Feng
Xiao was incredibly dissatisfied.</p><p>Because these
few days their plans were not going smoothly. Wen Liang and his people are
still in his prison, so the Lanling Alliance dare not create any mischief.
However, everyone there was no less amount of people appearing before his
doorstep to beg for mercy. Feng Xiao refused them all. He made Pei Jingzhe
check out on Cui Buqu frequently so he would attend the auction. The Qin family
did not show up, as if among the crowd, the Jade of Heaven’s Lake is utterly
lost.</p><p>Feng Xiao knew
that that even though the jade reappeared, it would be on the last day of the
auction. However, as he thought and thought, he felt as if he had missed
something and felt unsettled.</p><p>Ever since he
succeeded the House of Blades, everything he did had went well. He did not
remember the last time he met with such a difficult situation, as if he was a
chess piece being placed where the player wanted, among others. Originally
simply watching, now he felt as if he was lured into a mind game himself……</p><p>Feng Xiao was
stunned for a moment, as if he figured out something, but then it was gone in
an instant.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Last time, you ordered me to give that person five days’ &nbsp;worth of the Naihe drug, I’m afraid that he
couldn’t be able to stand it, so I didn’t dare use much. Just now when I went
in to take a look, he was already in a daze. I used a bucket of well water to
wake him up and made use of the interval to ask him some questions, but he
insist that he has nothing to do with the Qin family. So I think that Master
Cui is really innocent.”</p><p>If this person
isn’t innocent, then he has a heart of steel, achieving a degree that even the
Naihe drug couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>But is this
possible?</p><p>Let alone such
a sickly and weak person, even if he is a master of the fighting arts, Pei
Jingzhe has also never seem any of them able to withstand the power of the
Naihe drug. </p><p>Feng Xiao,
“Where is his person?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Sleeping in the East Wing.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
furrowed his eyebrows, “Is he released?”</p><p>Pei Jingzhe
laughed bitterly, “My dear Young Master, do you think that everyone is just
like you and could withstand the Naihe drug for so many days and still stand
up? He had a fever, let alone speaking, whether he is able to recover from his
current situation is still being discussed at length.”</p><p>Feng Xiao
snorted, “As long as he is still useful, make sure he remains alive. Use any
form of medicine.”</p><p>Hearing this,
Pei Jingzhe immediately thought Feng Xiao was going to use another drug and
quickly said, “The physician said that right now, he could not withstand any
more forms of torture!”</p><p>Feng Xiao did
not respond to this question.</p><p>He followed Pei
Jingzhe to the East Wing and saw for himself the sight of Cui Buqu sleeping on
the bed. A few days ago, those two cheeks that were obviously pale was not even
paler. His fingers stuck out from underneath the covers looked vaguely green. </p><p>Feng Xiao stood
next to the bed and looked Cui Buqu for nearly half a day. Cui Buqu also felt
that he was being watched, his eyebrows raised as he slept uncomfortably.</p><p>Pei Jingzhe,
“Young Master, are you planning to expel the poison from his body? Otherwise,
he would never be alright.”</p><p>Feng Xiao shook
his head, touching his chin, his gaze never left Cui Buqu. He looked as if he
was fighting in his dream, and he found it very interesting.</p><p>

After a while, he said suddenly, “Would you
think he might be a member of the Zhuoyue Alliance?”
