                This site is a fan translation of Wushuang / Unparralleled / Peerless written by Meng Xi Shi. I am just translating Wushuang
                as a casual hobby, and because I've found no English translation elsewhere and really wanted to get people into it.
                My biography is over here <a href="contact.html">Joan</a>. Any important or massive change to the site or translations will go here.

            <h3>Character Guide Added</h3>
            <p><b>2/11/2019</b></p>
            <p>
                With help from <a href="https://twitter.com/shiki_traumend">@shiki_traumend</a> from Twitter, I've uploaded a 
                <a href="guide.html">Character Guide</a> list. Currently it contains only 1/3 of the whole cast, more characters
                will be added as they get introduced in the story.

            <h3>Chapter 30 Onwards</h3>
            <p><b>2/11/2019</b></p>
            <p>
                Now that we have arrived at Chapter 30, Chapter 1 - 29 is now in an 'Unrevised' state, meaning they have not been beta
                or proof read, but will be going through that process in the future. So please excuse any obvious grammar mistakes or typos.
                However, from Chapter 30 onwards, I will be proof-reading the chapters personally before publishing them.
            </p>
